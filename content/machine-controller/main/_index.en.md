## Supported Kubernetes Versions

machine-controller tries to follow the Kubernetes version
[support policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/) as close as possible.

Currently supported Kubernetes versions are:

- 1.31
- 1.30
- 1.29

## Community Providers

Some cloud providers implemented in machine-controller have been graciously contributed by community
members. Those cloud providers are not part of the automated end-to-end tests run by the
machine-controller developers and thus, their status cannot be guaranteed. The machine-controller
developers assume that they are functional, but can only offer limited support for new features or
bugfixes in those providers.

The current list of community providers is:

- Linode
- Vultr
- OpenNebula
