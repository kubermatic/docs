## What is Kubermatic Virtualization (Kube-V)?
Kubermatic Virtualization (Kube-V) provides a unified platform that enables organizations to seamlessly orchestrate and manage both traditional virtual machines (VMs) and modern containerized applications.

It extends the powerful automation and operational benefits of Kubernetes to your VM-based workloads, allowing for a more consistent and efficient approach to infrastructure management.

Kubermatic Virtualization leverages Kubernetes-native management by unifying VM and container orchestration as it integrates virtual machines (VMs) directly into Kubernetes as native, first-class objects by managing, scaling, and deploying VMs using the same familiar Kubernetes tools, APIs, and workflows you already use for your containerized applications.
## Features
Kubermatic Virtualization offers a comprehensive set of features designed to modernize infrastructure and streamline operations by converging virtual machine and container management.

### Streamlined Transition and Unified Control

* Effortless Migration: Tools are provided to simplify the migration of existing VMs from diverse environments to the unified platform, making infrastructure modernization more accessible.
* Centralized Operations: Gain single-pane-of-glass management for the entire lifecycle of both VMs and containers. This includes everything from creation, networking, and storage to scaling and monitoring, all accessible from a centralized interface or command-line tools.

### Infrastructure Modernization and Efficiency

* Gradual Modernization Path: Integrate VMs into a cloud-native environment, offering a practical pathway to modernize legacy applications without the immediate need for extensive refactoring into containers. You can run new containerized applications alongside existing virtualized ones.
* Optimized Resource Use: By running VMs and containers on the same underlying physical infrastructure, organizations can achieve better hardware resource utilization and significantly reduce operational overhead.

### Enhanced Development and Reliability

* Improved Developer Experience: Developers can leverage familiar, native Kubernetes tools and workflows for managing both VMs and containers, which minimizes learning curves and speeds up development cycles.
* Automated Workflows (CI/CD): Integrate VMs seamlessly into Kubernetes-native CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated testing and deployment processes.
* Built-in Resilience: Benefit from the platform's inherent high availability and fault tolerance features, including automated restarts and live migration of VMs between nodes, ensuring continuous application uptime.
* Integrated Networking and Storage: VMs natively use the platform's software-defined networking (SDN) and storage capabilities, providing consistent network policies, enhanced security, and streamlined storage management.
