This page contains an administrator guide for the [User Cluster MLA Stack]({{< relref "../../../../architecture/monitoring-logging-alerting/user-cluster/" >}}).
The user guide is available at [User Cluster MLA User Guide]({{< relref "../user-guide/" >}}) page.

## Installation

The User Cluster MLA stack components have to be manually installed into every KKP Seed cluster.

### Requirements

At the minimal scale (to process MLA data from several user clusters), the stack requires the following resources in the seed cluster:

- 2 vCPUs
- 14 GB of RAM

Apart from that,  it will claim the following storage from the `kubermatic-fast` storage class:

- 50 Gi volume for MinIO (object store for logs, metrics, and alertmanager configurations, etc.)
- 10 Gi volume for Grafana
- 10 Gi volume for each Ingester instance (3 Loki Ingesters + 3 Cortex Ingesters by default)
- 10 Gi volume for Loki Querier
- 4 x 2 Gi volume for other internal processing services (compactors, store gateways of Cortex and Loki)

### Capacity Planning

{{% notice note %}}
The most important part of resources consumption of the MLA stack belongs to the storage and computing power used by Cortex and it's components.
For specific information about estimating the resource usage, please refer to [Cortex capacity planning documentation](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/guides/capacity-planning/).
{{% /notice %}}

Some key parameters to consider are:

* The number of active series
* Sampling rate
* The rate at which series are added and removed
* How compressible the time-series data are

Other parameters which can become important if you have particularly high values:

* Number of different series under one metric name
* Number of labels per series
* Rate and complexity of queries

### Installing MLA Stack in a Seed Cluster

#### Deploy Seed Cluster Components

The MLA stack can be deployed by using the Kubermatic Installer:

```bash
kubermatic-installer deploy usercluster-mla --config <kubermatic.yaml> --helm-values <mlavalues.yaml>
```

Additional options that can be used for the installation include:
```bash
--mla-force-secrets                (UserCluster MLA) force reinstallation of mla-secrets Helm chart
--mla-include-iap                  (UserCluster MLA) Include Identity-Aware Proxy installation
--mla-skip-minio                   (UserCluster MLA) skip installation of UserCluster MLA Minio
--mla-skip-minio-lifecycle-mgr     (UserCluster MLA) skip installation of userCluster MLA Minio Bucket Lifecycle Manager
```

This will deploy all MLA stack components with the default settings, which may be sufficient for smaller scale setups (several user clusters). If any customization is needed for any of the components, The helm values for the MLA stack can be adjusted and the installer can be re-run to redeploy and reconfigure the components.

This default installation will deploy a MinIO instance which will be used by MLA components for storage. If you would like to re-use an existing MinIO instance in your cluster or other S3-compatiable srevices from cloud providers, please refer to [Setting up MLA with Existing MinIO or Other S3-compatiable Services](#setting-up-mla-with-existing-minio-or-other-s3-compatiable-services).

#### Setup Seed Cluster Components for High Availability

By default, Cortex and Loki are deployed for high-availability, but Grafana is not.
If you want to set up Grafana for high availability, you just need to set up a shared database for storing dashboard, users and other persistent data. For more details, please refer to the [official HA guide setup guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/set-up-for-high-availability/).

#### Expose Grafana & Alertmanager UI

After deploying MLA components into a KKP Seed cluster, Grafana and Alertmanager UI are exposed only via ClusterIP services by default. To expose them to users outside of the Seed cluster with proper authentication in place, we will use the [IAP Helm chart](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/tree/main/charts/iap) from the Kubermatic Installer package.

As a matter of rule, to integrate well with KKP UI, Grafana and Alertmanager should be exposed at the URL `https://<any-prefix>.<seed-name>.<kkp-domain>`, for example:

- `https://grafana.<seed-name>.<kkp-domain>`
- `https://alertmanager.<seed-name>.<kkp-domain>`

The prefixes chosen for Grafana and Alertmanager then need to be configured in the KKP [Admin Panel Configuration](#admin-panel-configuration) to enable KKP UI integration.

Let's start with preparing the values.yaml for the IAP Helm Chart. A starting point can be found in the `example/values.example.mla.yaml` file of the installer package:

- Modify the base domain under which your KKP installation is available (`kkp.example.com` in `iap.oidc_issuer_url`).
- Set `grafana."grafana.ini".server.domain` to match the domain under which you want to expose Grafana (e.g. grafana.kkp.example.com)
- Modify the base domain, seed name and Grafana prefix as described above (`grafana.seed-cluster-x.kkp.example.com` in `iap.deployments.grafana.ingress.host`).
- Set `iap.deployments.grafana.client_secret` + `iap.deployments.grafana.encryption_key` and `iap.deployments.alertmanager.client_secret` + `iap.deployments.alertmanager.encryption_key` to the newly generated key values (they can be generated e.g. with `cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c32`).
- Configure how the users should be authenticated in `iap.deployments.grafana.config` and `iap.deployments.alertmanager.config` (e.g. modify `YOUR_GITHUB_ORG` and `YOUR_GITHUB_TEAM` placeholders). Please check the [OAuth Provider Configuration](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/docs/configuration/oauth_provider/) for more details.
- Make the corresponding changes for the Alertmanager config as well.

It is also necessary to set up your infrastructure accordingly:

- Configure your DNS with the DNS entry for the domain name that you used in `iap.deployments.grafana.ingress.host` and `iap.deployments.alertmanager.ingress.host` so that it points to the ingress-controller service of KKP.
- Configure the Dex in KKP with the proper configuration for Grafana and Alertmanager IAP, e.g. using the following snippet that can be placed into the KKP values.yaml. Make sure to modify the `RedirectURIs` with your domain name used in `iap.deployments.grafana.ingress.host` and `iap.deployments.alertmanager.ingress.host` and secret with your `iap.deployments.grafana.client_secret` and `iap.deployments.alertmanager.client_secret`:

```yaml
dex:
  clients:
  - RedirectURIs:
    - https://grafana.seed-cluster-x.kkp.example.com/oauth/callback
    id: mla-grafana
    name: mla-grafana
    secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
  - RedirectURIs:
    - https://alertmanager.seed-cluster-x.kkp.example.com/oauth/callback
    id: mla-alertmanager
    name: mla-alertmanager
    secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

At this point, we can install the IAP Helm chart into the mla namespace as follows:

```bash
kubermatic-installer deploy usercluster-mla --config <kubermatic.yaml> --helm-values <mlavalues.yaml> --mla-include-iap
```

For more information about how to secure your services in KKP using IAP and Dex, please check [Securing System Services Documentation]({{< ref "../../../../architecture/concept/kkp-concepts/kkp-security/securing-system-services/">}}).

## Setup

Once the User Cluster MLA stack is installed in all necessary seed clusters, it needs to be configured as described in this section.

### Enabling MLA Feature in KKP Configuration

Since the User Cluster MLA feature is in alpha stage, it has to be explicitly enabled via a feature gate in the `KubermaticConfiguration`, e.g.:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubermatic.k8c.io/v1
kind: KubermaticConfiguration
metadata:
  name: kubermatic
  namespace: kubermatic
spec:
  featureGates:
    UserClusterMLA: true
```

### Enabling MLA Stack in a Seed

Since the MLA stack has to be manually installed into every KKP Seed Cluster, it is necessary to explicitly enable it on the Seed Cluster level after it is installed. This can be done via `mla.userClusterMLAEnabled` option of the `Seed` Custom Resource / API object, e.g.:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubermatic.k8c.io/v1
kind: Seed
metadata:
  name: europe-west3-c
  namespace: kubermatic
spec:
  mla:
    userClusterMLAEnabled: true
```

### Admin Panel Configuration

There are several options in the KKP “Admin Panel” which are related to user cluster MLA, as shown on the picture below:

![MLA Admin Panel](/img/kubermatic/main/monitoring/user_cluster/admin_panel.png)

**User Cluster Logging:**

- **Enabled by Default**: If this checkbox is selected, User Cluster Logging will be enabled by default in the cluster creation page.
- **Enforce**: If this is selected, User Cluster Logging will be enabled by default, and users will not be able to change it.

**User Cluster Monitoring:**

- **Enabled by Default**: If this checkbox is selected, User Cluster Monitoring will be enabled by default in the cluster creation page.
- **Enforce**: If this is selected, User Cluster Monitoring will be enabled by default, and users will not be able to change it.

**User Cluster Alertmanager Prefix:**

- Domain name prefix on which the User Cluster Alertmanager will be exposed to KKP users. It has to be the same prefix that has been used during the MLA stack installation in the Seed cluster (see [Expose Grafana & Alertmanager UI](#expose-grafana--alertmanager-ui)).
- Seed name and the base domain under which KKP is running will be appended to it, e.g. for prefix `alertmanager` the final URL would be `https://alertmanager.<seed-name>.<kkp-domain>`.

**User Cluster Grafana Prefix:**

- Domain name prefix on which the User Cluster Grafana will be exposed to KKP users. It has to be the same prefix that has been used during the MLA stack installation in the Seed cluster (see [Expose Grafana & Alertmanager UI](#expose-grafana--alertmanager-ui)).
- Seed name and the base domain under which KKP is running will be appended to it, e.g. for prefix `grafana` the final URL would be `https://grafana.<seed-name>.<kkp-domain>`.

### Addons Configuration
KKP provides several addons for user clusters, that can be helpful when the User Cluster Monitoring feature is enabled, namely:
- **node-exporter** addon: exposes hardware and OS metrics of worker nodes to Prometheus,
- **kube-state-metrics** addon: exposes cluster-level metrics of Kubernetes API objects (like pods, deployments, etc.) to Prometheus.

When these addons are deployed to user clusters, no further configuration of the user cluster MLA stack is needed,
the exposed metrics will be scraped by user cluster monitoring agent and become available in Grafana automatically.

Before addons can be deployed into KKP user clusters, the KKP installation has to be configured to enable them
as [accessible addons]({{< relref "../../../../architecture/concept/kkp-concepts/addons/#accessible-addons" >}}). The `node-exporter` and `kube-state-metrics`
addons are part of the KKP default accessible addons, so they should be available out-of-the box, unless the KKP installation
administrator has changed it.

### Enabling alerts for MLA stack in a Seed
To enable alerts in seed cluster for user cluster MLA stack(cortex and loki) , update the `values.yaml` used for installation of [Master / Seed MLA stack]({{< relref "../../master-seed/installation/" >}}). Add the following line under `prometheus.ruleFiles` label:
```yaml
- /etc/prometheus/rules/usercluster-mla-*.yaml
```

With this update in `values.yaml`, we can now upgrade the Prometheus chart:

**Helm 3**

```bash
helm --namespace monitoring upgrade --install --wait --values /path/to/your/helm-values.yaml prometheus charts/monitoring/prometheus/
```

## Operation

### Setup Customization

The default settings of the MLA stack components are sufficient for smaller scale setups (several user clusters). Whenever a larger scale is needed these settings should be adapted accordingly.

User Cluster MLA stack components setting can be adapted by modifying (using your own) their `value.yaml` files. Available Helm chart options can be reviewed in the MLA repo:

- [Cortex values](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/tree/main/charts/mla/cortex#values)
- [Loki values](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/tree/main/charts/mla/loki-distributed#values)
- [Grafana values](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/tree/main/charts/mla/grafana#configuration)

For larger scales, you will may start with tweaking the following:

- Size of the object store used to persist metrics data and logs (minio `values.yaml` - `minio.persistence.size`) - default: 50Gi
- Storage & Data Retention Settings (see the next chapter)
- Cortex Ingester replicas (cortex values.yaml - `cortex.ingester.replicas`) - default 3
- Cortex Ingester volume sizes (cortex values.yaml - `cortex.ingester.persistentVolume.size`) - default 10Gi
- Loki Ingester replicas (loki values.yaml - `loki-distributed.ingester.replicas`) - default 3
- Loki Ingester volume sizes (loki values.yaml - `loki-distributed.ingester.persistentVolume.size`) - default 10Gi

**Grafana:**

- [Set up Grafana for high availability](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/set-up-for-high-availability/)

### Storage & Data Retention Settings

By default, the MLA stack is configured to hold the logs and metrics in the object store for 7 days. This can be overridden for logs and metrics separately:

**For the metrics:**

- In the [cortex Helm chart values.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/blob/main/charts/mla/cortex/values.yaml#L208), set `cortex.config.limits.max_query_lookback` to the desired value (default: `168h` = 7 days).
- In the [minio-lifecycle-mgr Helm chart values.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/blob/main/charts/mla/minio-lifecycle-mgr/values.yaml#L18), set `lifecycleMgr.buckets[name=cortex].expirationDays` to the value used in the cortex Helm chart + 1 day (default: `8d`).

**For the logs:**

- In the [loki Helm chart values.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/blob/main/charts/mla/loki-distributed/values.yaml#L52), set `loki-distributed.loki.config.chunk_store_config.max_look_back_period` to the desired value (default: `168h` = 7 days).
- In the [minio-lifecycle-mgr Helm chart values.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/blob/main/charts/mla/minio-lifecycle-mgr/values.yaml#L20), set `lifecycleMgr.buckets[name=loki].expirationDays` to the value used in the loki Helm chart + 1 day (default: `8d`).

### Setting up MLA with Existing MinIO or Other S3-compatiable Services

By default, a MinIO instance will also be deployed as the S3 storage backend for MLA components. It is also possible to use an existing MinIO instance in your cluster or any other S3-compatiable services.

There are three Helm charts which are related to MinIO in MLA repository:
- [mla-secrets](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/tree/main/charts/mla/mla-secrets) is used to create and manage MinIO and Grafana credentials Secrets.
- [minio](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/tree/main/charts/mla/minio) is used to deploy MinIO instance in Kubernetes cluster.
- [minio-lifecycle-mgr](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/tree/main/charts/mla/minio-lifecycle-mgr) is used to manage the lifecycle of the stored data, and to take care of data retention.

If you want to disable the MinIO installation and use your existing MinIO instance or other S3 services, you need to:
- Disable the Secret creation for MinIO in mla-secrets Helm chart. In the [mla-secrets Helm chart values.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/blob/main/charts/mla/mla-secrets/values.yaml#L18), set `mlaSecrets.minio.enabled` to `false`.
- Modify the S3 storage settings in `values.yaml` of other MLA components to use the existing MinIO instance or other S3 services:
  - In [cortex Helm chart values.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/blob/main/charts/mla/cortex/values.yaml), change the `cortex.config.ruler.storage.s3`, `cortex.config.alertmanager.storage.s3`, and `cortex.config.blocks_storage.s3` to point to your MinIO instance. Modify the `cortex.ruler.env`, `cortex.storage_gateway.env`, `cortex.ingester.env`, `cortex.querier.env` and `cortex.alertmanager.env` to get credentials from your Secret.
  - In [loki Helm chart values.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/blob/main/charts/mla/loki-distributed/values.yaml), change the `loki-distributed.storage_config.aws` and `loki-distributed.ruler.storage.s3` in the `loki-distributed.loki.config` to point to your MinIO instance or S3 service. Modify `extraEnvFrom` of `loki-distributed.tableManager`, `loki-distributed.ingester`, `loki-distributed.querier`, `loki-distributed.ruler` and `loki-distributed.compactor` to get credentials from your Secret.
  - If you still want to use MinIO lifecycle manager to manage data retention for MLA data in your MinIO instance, in [minio-lefecycle-mgr Helm chart values.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/blob/main/charts/mla/minio-lifecycle-mgr/values.yaml), set `lifecycleMgr.minio.endpoint` and `lifecycleMgr.minio.secretName` to your MinIO endpoint and Secret.
- Use `--mla-skip-minio` or `--mla-skip-minio-lifecycle-mgr` flag when you execute `kubermatic-installer deploy usercluster-mla`. If you want to disable MinIO but still use MinIO lifecycle manager to take care of data retention, you can use `--mla-skip-minio` flag. Otherwise, you can use both flags to disable both MinIO and lifecycle manager. Please note that if you are redeploying the stack on existing cluster, you will have to manually uninstall MinIO and/or lifecycle manager. To do that, you can use commands: `helm uninstall --namespace mla minio` and `helm uninstall --namespace mla minio-lifecycle-mgr` accordingly.


### Managing Grafana Dashboards

In the User Cluster MLA Grafana, there are several predefined Grafana dashboards that are automatically available across all Grafana organizations (KKP projects). The KKP administrators have ability to modify the list of these dashboards.

There are three ways for managing them:

- Modify the already existing (pre-created) configmaps with the `grafana-dashboards` prefix in the `mla` namespace in the Seed cluster. These configmaps contain the Grafana dashboards that are already available across all KKP projects. You can add or remove Dashboards by modifying these configmaps. Be aware that these changes can be overwritten by MLA stack upgrade.

- Create a new configmap with the `grafana-dashboards` name prefix in the `mla` namespace in the Seed cluster. You can add multiple such configmaps with your dashboards json data. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: grafana-dashboards-example
  namespace: mla
data:
  example-dashboard.json: <your-dashboard-json-data>
```

- Add dashboards to the User Cluster MLA Grafana Helm chart values. You can add dashboards into the `grafana.dashboards` section of the [values.yaml file](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/blob/main/charts/mla/grafana/values.yaml#L41).

After the new dashboards are applied to the Seed Cluster, they will become available across all Grafana Organizations, and they can be found in the Grafana UI under Dashboards -> Manage.

### Managing Alerting and Recording Rules

Similar to managing Grafana Dashboards, KKP administrators can also pre-define Prometheus-compatible rules for metrics and logs and make them automatically available across all KKP user clusters with MLA enabled.

Rule groups can be managed via the following API endpoints, which are only available for KKP administrator users:

- `GET /api/v2/seeds/{seed_name}/rulegroups` - list rule groups
- `GET /api/v2/seeds/{seed_name}/rulegroups/{rulegroup_id}` - get rule group
- `POST /api/v2/seeds/{seed_name}/rulegroups` - create rule group
- `PUT  /api/v2/seeds/{seed_name}/rulegroups/{rulegroup_id}` - update rule group
- `DELETE /api/v2/seeds/{seed_name}/rulegroups/{rulegroup_id}` - delete rule group

### Rate-Limiting

In order to prevent from denial of service by abusive users of misconfigured applications, the write path and read path of the User Cluster MLA stack can be configured with rate-limits per user cluster.

Rate-limiting can be configured via the following API endpoints of `MLAAdminSetting` - available only for KKP administrator users:

- `GET /api/v2/projects/{project_id}/clusters/{cluster_id}/mlaadminsetting` - get admin settings
- `POST /api/v2/projects/{project_id}/clusters/{cluster_id}/mlaadminsetting` - create admin settings
- `PUT /api/v2/projects/{project_id}/clusters/{cluster_id}/mlaadminsetting` - update admin settings
- `DELETE /api/v2/projects/{project_id}/clusters/{cluster_id}/mlaadminsetting` - delete admin settings

By default, no rate-limiting is applied. Configuring the rate-limiting options with zero values has the same effect.

For **metrics**, the following rate-limiting options are supported as part of the `monitoringRateLimits`:

| Option               | Direction  | Enforced by | Description
| -------------------- | -----------| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------
| `ingestionRate`      | Write path | Cortex      | Ingestion rate limit in samples per second (Cortex `ingestion_rate`).
| `ingestionBurstSize` | Write path | Cortex      | Maximum number of series per metric (Cortex `max_series_per_metric`).
| `maxSeriesPerMetric` | Write path | Cortex      | Maximum number of series per this user cluster (Cortex `max_series_per_user`).
| `maxSeriesTotal`     | Write path | Cortex      | Maximum number of series per this user cluster (Cortex `max_series_per_user`).
| `queryRate`          | Read path  | MLA Gateway | Query request rate limit per second (NGINX `rate` in `r/s`).
| `queryBurstSize`     | Read path  | MLA Gateway | Query burst size in number of requests (NGINX `burst`).
| `maxSamplesPerQuery` | Read path  | Cortex      | Maximum number of samples during a query (Cortex `max_samples_per_query`).
| `maxSeriesPerQuery`  | Read path  | Cortex      | Maximum number of timeseries during a query (Cortex `max_series_per_query`).

For **logs**, the following rate-limiting options are supported as part of the `loggingRateLimits`:

| Option               | Direction  | Enforced by | Description
| -------------------- | -----------| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------
| `ingestionRate`      | Write path | MLA Gateway | Ingestion rate limit in requests per second (NGINX `rate` in `r/s`).
| `ingestionBurstSize` | Write path | MLA Gateway | Ingestion burst size in number of requests (NGINX `burst`).
| `queryRate`          | Read path  | MLA Gateway | Query request rate limit per second (NGINX `rate` in `r/s`).
| `queryBurstSize`     | Read path  | MLA Gateway | Query burst size in number of requests (NGINX `burst`).

## Debugging

This chapter describes some potential problems that you may face in a KKP installation and the steps you can take to resolve then.

**Prometheus / Loki datasource for an user cluster is not available in the Grafana UI:**

- Make sure you are switched to the proper Grafana Organization (see the “Switch between Grafana Organizations” section of this documentation)
- Make sure that user cluster Monitoring / Logging is enabled for the user cluster (In KKP UI, you should see green checkboxes on the Cluster Page):

![MLA UI - Cluster View](/img/kubermatic/main/monitoring/user_cluster/ui_cluster_view.png)

**Metrics / Logs are not available in Grafana UI for some user cluster:**

- Make sure that User Cluster Monitoring / Logging is enabled for the user cluster (In KKP UI, you should see green checkboxes on the Cluster Page):

![MLA UI - Cluster View](/img/kubermatic/main/monitoring/user_cluster/ui_cluster_view.png)

- Check that Monitoring / Logging Agent was deployed an is running in the user cluster:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n mla-system
```

Output will be similar to this:
```bash
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
monitoring-agent-68f7485456-jj7v6   1/1     Running   0          11m
logging-agent-cm4qd                 1/1     Running   0          6m11s
```

- Check the logs of monitoring agent / logging agent pods
- Check that the MLA Gateway pod is running in the user cluster namespace in the Seed cluster:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n cluster-cxfmstjqkw | grep mla-gateway
```

Output will be similar to this:
```bash
mla-gateway-6dd8c68d67-knmq7                  1/1     Running   0          22m
```

- Check the logs of the MLA Gateway pods
- Check the status of the pods in the `mla` namespace in the seed cluster:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n mla
```

- If there are any pods crashing, review their logs for the root cause

## Uninstallation

{{% notice warning %}}

Before proceeding with any of the following steps, make sure that you backup all data that you may still need - metrics data / logs in the object store, alertmanager / rules configuration, Grafana dashboards.

{{% /notice %}}

In order to uninstall the User Cluster MLA stack from a seed cluster (and all user clusters serviced by that seed cluster), follow the 3 steps in this order:

- Disable the User Cluster MLA feature in Seed configuration
- Remove the User Cluster MLA components from Seed
- Remove the User Cluster MLA data from Seed

### Disabling the User Cluster MLA in Seed Configuration

In order to disable the User Cluster MLA feature for a Seed Cluster, set the `mla.userClusterMLAEnabled` option of the `Seed` Custom Resource / API object to `false`, e.g.:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubermatic.k8c.io/v1
kind: Seed
metadata:
  name: europe-west3-c
  namespace: kubermatic
spec:
  mla:
    userClusterMLAEnabled: false
```

### Removing the User Cluster MLA Components

In order to uninstall the user cluster MLA stack components from a Seed cluster, first disable it in the `Seed` Custom Resource / API object as described in the previous section. After that, you can safely remove the resources in the `mla` namespace of the Seed Cluster.

You can do that on per-component basis using Helm - see the list of the helm Charts in the `mla` namespace:

```bash
 helm ls -n mla
```

E.g. to uninstall Cortex, run:

```bash
helm delete cortex -n mla
```

## Upgrade

To incorporate the helm-charts upgrade, follow the below steps:

### Upgrade Loki to version 2.4.0

Add the following configuration inside `loki.config` key, under `ingester` label in the Loki's `values.yaml` file:
```yaml
wal:
  dir: /var/loki/wal
```

### Upgrade Cortex to version 1.9.0

Statefulset `store-gateway` refers to a headless service called `cortex-store-gateway-headless`, however, due to a bug in the upstream helm-chart(v0.5.0), the `cortex-store-gateway-headless` doesn’t exist at all, and headless service is named `cortex-store-gateway`, which is not used by the statefulset. Because `cortex-store-gateway` is not referred at all, we can safely delete it, and do helm upgrade to fix the issue (Refer to this [pull-request](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex-helm-chart/pull/166) for details).

Delete the existing `cortex-store-gateway` service by running the below command:
```bash
kubectl delete svc cortex-store-gateway -n mla
```

After doing the above-mentioned steps, MLA stack can be upgraded using the Kubermatic Installer:
```bash
kubermatic-installer deploy usercluster-mla --config <kubermatic.yaml> --helm-values <mlavalues.yaml>
```
