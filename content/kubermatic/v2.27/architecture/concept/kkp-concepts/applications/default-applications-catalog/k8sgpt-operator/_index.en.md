# What is K8sGPT-Operator?
This operator is designed to enable K8sGPT within a Kubernetes cluster. 

It will allow you to create a custom resource that defines the behaviour and scope of a managed K8sGPT workload. 

Analysis and outputs will also be configurable to enable integration into existing workflows.

For more information on the K8sGPT-Operator, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.k8sgpt.ai/reference/operator/overview/)

It can be deployed to the user cluster either during the cluster creation or after the cluster is ready(existing cluster) from the Applications tab via UI.
