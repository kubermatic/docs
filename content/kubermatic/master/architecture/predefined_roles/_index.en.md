## Overview

A project is an entity that holds various resources.  All resources in a project are equal in terms of the `groups` attached
to them. Affiliation of a `user` to one of the `groups` gives them certain powers they are allowed to use within a project.

### Kubermatic Kubernetes Platform (KKP) roles

There are three roles: owner, editor, and viewer. These roles are concentric; that is, the owner role includes the permissions
of the editor role, and the editor role includes the permissions of the viewer role.

  - **viewer**: read-only access to see project resources

  - **editor**: can see the project content that the viewer can view and additionally can create, edit and delete clusters in the project

  - **owner**: can do everything that the editor can do and additionally manage permissions for the project

The following table summarizes the permissions:

| Name                                              | Permissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| viewer                                            | Permissions for read-only actions that do not affect the state, such as viewing.<br>Viewers are not allowed to interact with service accounts (user).<br>Viewers are not allowed to interact with members of a project (UserProjectBinding)                                            |
| editor                                            | All viewer permissions, plus permissions to create, edit & delete the cluster.<br>Editors are not allowed to delete a project. Editors are not allowed to interact with members of a project (UserProjectBinding).<br>Editors are not allowed to interact with service accounts (user) |
| owner (role can not be held by a service account) | All editor permissions and permissions for managing permissions for a project.<br>Only the owners of a project can create a service account (aka. users) <br>Only the owners of a project can manipulate members                                                                        |

### KKP Service Accounts

A service account is a special type of user account that belongs to the KKP project, instead of to an individual
end-user. A service account is considered as project's resource. Only the owner of a project can create and update a
service account. There is no need to create new groups for service accounts. Itâ€™s assigned to one of the already defined
groups: `editors` or `viewers`.
