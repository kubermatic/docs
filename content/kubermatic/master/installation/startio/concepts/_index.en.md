Using this wizard will provide you with a pre-configured setup of the KKP based on your configuration inputs.

It is using a combination of various tools to handle all steps for you.

## Prerequisites

### AWS account or vSphere deployment

You'll need static credentials for the CLI tools in case of AWS.

### GitHub or GitLab repository
It will be used for storing the declarative setup of all components,
can be either public or private, managed by user or organization.

### Hosted DNS domain
For setting up DNS endpoint for accessing KKP and other components
(if you have Route53 - records preparation can be fully automated as long as the hosted zone is the same account as other AWS resources).
