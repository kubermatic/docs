## Disclaimer
This project is in early version at this stage.

This project should serve mainly for the onboarding purposes and easiness to start with KKP. Make sure that you fully
understand all parts and perform internal security checks before making your setup a production ready.

At this stage, there are following limitations:
 * only AWS and vSphere are available as the cloud providers
 * GitHub and GitLab are supported for storing and integration with GitOps tool
 * KKP CE edition is used.

All the above limitations may change in upcoming iterations.
