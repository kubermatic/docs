Install the [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops#download) tool locally (version `3.7.1` is used
in the automated pipeline).

## Decrypt the file
Take the values of AGE secret (from `secrets.md`) and put it in a file, e.g. `.age.txt`.

```shell
export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=.age.txt
sops -d kubermatic/kubermatic-configuration.yaml
sops -d kubermatic/values.yaml
```

With above commands, you will get on standard output the decrypted content of the files.
You can also use `-i` option to use the in-place update of the file.

{{% notice warning %}}
Make sure that you never commit the files with decrypted values inside your repository!
{{% /notice %}}

## Encrypt the values

If you want to update some values or encrypt a new ones, you will need the AGE public key (set in `AGE_PUBLIC_KEY` variable)
which is passed to the `sops` command.
```shell
sops -e --encrypted-regex 'secret|Secret|key|Key|password|hash' --age $AGE_PUBLIC_KEY kubermatic/values.yaml
```

{{% notice info %}}
You should decrypt the whole file if you are willing to update some parts, otherwise `sops` will complain
that there the file has already some encrypted values.
