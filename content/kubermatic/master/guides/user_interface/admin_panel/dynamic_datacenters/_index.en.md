Dynamic Datacenters view on the bottom of the Admin Panel allows Administrators to control the datacenters available
in KKP. The most important capabilities that this view provides are listing, filtering, creating, editing and deleting
datacenters. All of these will be described below.

## Listing & Filtering Datacenters
Besides traditional list functionalities the Dynamic Datacenter view provides filtering options. Datacenters can be
filtered by:

- Seed
- Country
- Provider

Filters are applied together, that means result datacenters have to match all the filtering criteria.

## Creating & Editing Datacenters
Datacenters can be added after clicking on the plus icon in the top right corner of the Dynamic Datacenters view. To
edit datacenter Administrator should click on the pencil icon that appears after putting mouse over one of the rows with
datacenters.

In both cases the dialog will look very similar but in the edit mode not all fields can be changed. Provider and seed
can be set only during the datacenter creation.
