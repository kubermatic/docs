Audit Logging is one of the key security features provided by Kubernetes. Once enabled in the Kubernetes API server, it provides a chronological record of operations performed on the cluster by users, administrators and other cluster components.

Audit logging is also a key requirement of the [Kubernetes CIS benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/).

For more details, you can refer to the [upstream documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/).

### Kubermatic Kubernetes Platform (KKP) Support
KKP provides two levels of support for the Audit Logging:

* Audit Logging on user-cluster level
* Audit Logging on a datacenter level

{{% notice note %}}
Kubernetes Audit Logging is optional and is not enabled by default, since it requires additional memory and storage resources, depending on the specific configuration used.
{{% /notice %}}

Audit logs, if enabled, are emitted by a sidecar container called `audit-logs` in the `kubernetes-apiserver` Pods on the [Seed Cluster]({{< ref "../../architecture/#seed-cluster" >}}) in your cluster namespace. Setting up [the MLA stack on Master / Seed]({{< ref "../monitoring_logging_alerting/master_seed/installation" >}}) will allow storing the audit logs alongside other Pod logs collected by the MLA stack.

if you do not choose an [audit policy preset](#audit-policy-presets), KKP will set up a minimal [audit policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/#audit-policy) for you.
This file is stored in a ConfigMap named `audit-config` on the [Seed Cluster]({{< ref "../../architecture/#seed-cluster" >}}) in your cluster namespace. To modify the default policy, you can edit this ConfigMap using `kubectl`:

```bash
$ kubectl edit -n cluster-<YOUR CLUSTER ID> configmap audit-config
```

```yaml
{{< readfile "kubermatic/master/data/policy.yaml">}}
```

#### Audit Policy Presets

KKP supports a set of maintained audit policies as presets in case you do not want to tune the audit policy for yourself.
A preset can be selected during cluster creation in the UI or by setting the field `auditLogging.policyPreset` on a
user-cluster spec (when audit logging is enabled). The preset selection can be unset by setting the field to an empty string.

{{% notice note %}}
Enabling an audit policy preset on your user-cluster will override any manual changes to the `audit-config` ConfigMap.

The following presets are available right now:

- `metadata`: Logs metadata for any request (matches the default policy configured when using no policy preset)
- `minimal`: Is considered the bare minimum that allows to audit for key operations on the cluster. Logs the following operations:
    - any modification to `Pods`, `Deployments`, `StatefulSets`, `DaemonSets` and `ReplicaSets` (complete request and response bodies)
    - any access to Pods via shell (by using `exec` to spawn a process) or port-forwarding/proxy (complete request and response bodies)
    - access to container logs (metadata only)
    - any access (read, write or delete) to `Secrets` and `ConfigMaps` (metadata only, as the request body could include sensitive information)
- `recommended`: Logs everything in `minimal` plus metadata for any other request. This is the most verbose audit policy preset, but is recommended due to its extended coverage of security recommendations like the CIS Benchmark

#### User-Cluster Level Audit Logging

To enable user-cluster level Audit Logging, simply check `Audit Logging` in the KKP dashboard `Create Cluster` page. You can either select "custom" to be able to edit the ConfigMap for audit logging later on or set your cluster up with a [preset](#audit-policy-presets):

For exiting clusters, you can go to the cluster page, edit your cluster and enable (or disable) `Audit Logging`:

#### Datacenter Level Audit Logging

KKP also supports enabling Audit Logging on the datacenter level. In this case, the option is enforced on all user-clusters in the datacenter. The user-cluster level flag is ignored in this case.

To enable this, you will need to edit your [datacenter definitions in a Seed]({{< ref "../../tutorials_howtos/administration/dynamic_data_centers/" >}}), and set `enforceAuditLogging` to `true` in the datacenter spec.
