## Add GKE cluster

You can add an existing Kubernetes cluster and then manage it using KKP. From the Clusters page, click `External Clusters`.
Click `Add External Cluster` button. Pick `Google Kubernetes Engine` provider.

Select preset with valid credentials or enter GKE Service Account to connect to the provider.

You should see the list of all available clusters. Select the one and click the `Import Cluster` button. Once imported cluster
is unique for the project. The same cluster can be added for the other projects.

## Cluster details page

Your cluster is added. The KKP controller retrieves the cluster kubeconfig to display all necessary information. When
everything is fine the cluster is in the `Running` state. Otherwise, the cluster can be in the `Error` state. Move the mouse cursor over the
state indicator to get more details. You can also expand `Events` to get information from the controller.
