## Import EKS Cluster

You can add an existing Kubernetes cluster and then manage it using KKP.

- Navigate to `External Clusters` page.

- Click the `Import External Cluster` button

![Add External Cluster](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/external_cluster_page.png "Add External Cluster")

- Pick `Elastic Kubernetes Engine` provider.

![Select Provider](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/connect.png "Select Provider")

- Provide Credentials in either of the below mentioned ways:
    - Select a pre-created preset which stores the provider specific credentials.

    - Manually enter the credentials `Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key` and select `Region`

{{% notice info %}}
Region is also kept as a part of a preset as it is a required value to create an EKS client.
{{% /notice %}}

- After user provides all required credentials, credentials will be validated.

{{% notice info %}}
Validation performed will only check if the credentials have `Read` access.
{{% /notice %}}

![EKS credentials](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/eks_credentials.png "EKS credentials")

You should see the list of all available clusters in the region specified. Select the one and click the `Import Cluster` button. Clusters can be imported only once in a single project. The same cluster can be imported in other projects.

## Create EKS Preset
Admin can create a preset on a KKP cluster using KKP `Admin Panel`.
This Preset can then be used to Create/Import an EKS cluster.

- Click on `Admin Panel` from the menu.

![Select Admin Panel](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/select_adminpanel.png "Select Admin Panel")

- Navigate to `Provider Presets` Page and Click on `+ Create Preset` button.

![Provider Preset Page](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/preset_management.png?height=300px&classes=shadow,border "Provider Preset Page")

- Enter Preset Name.

![Provide Preset Name](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/create_ekspreset.png "Provide Preset Name")

- Choose `Elastic Kubernetes Service` from the list of providers.

![Choose EKS Preset](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/choose_akspreset.png "Choose EKS Preset")

-  Enter EKS credentials and Click on `Create` button.

![Enter Credentials](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/enter_eks_credentials_preset.png "Enter Credentials")

- You can now use created EKS Preset to Create or Import EKS Cluster.

![Select EKS Preset](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/existing_eks_preset.png "Select EKS Preset")

## Cluster Details Page

After the cluster is added, the KKP controller retrieves the cluster kubeconfig to display all necessary information.
A healthy cluster has `Running` state. Move the mouse cursor over the state indicator to get more details.

![EKS cluster](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/eks_details.png "EKS cluster")

You can also expand `Events` to get information from the controller.

![Cluster Events](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/eks_cluster_events.png "Cluster Events")

You can also click on `Machine Deployments` to get the details:

![EKS Machine Deployment](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/eks_machine_deployments.png "EKS Machine Deployment")

## Update Cluster

### Upgrade Version

To upgrade, click on the little dropdown arrow beside the `Control Plane Version` on the clusterâ€™s page and select the version from the dropdown. For more details about EKS available Kubernetes versions
[Amazon EKS Kubernetes versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html "Amazon EKS Kubernetes versions")

![Upgrade Available](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/eks_upgrade_available.png "Upgrade Available")

![Upgrade EKS](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/upgrade_eks.png "Upgrade EKS")

If the upgrade version provided is valid, the cluster state will change to `Reconciling`

### Edit the Machine Deployment

{{% notice info %}}
Only one operation can be performed at one point of time. If the replica count is updated then Kubernetes version upgrade will be disabled and vice versa.
{{% /notice %}}

- Navigate to the cluster overview, scroll down to machine deployments.

- Click on the edit icon next to the machine deployment you want to edit.

![Update EKS Machine Deployment](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/edit_md.png "Update EKS Machine Deployment")

- Upgrade Kubernetes Version. Select the Kubernetes Version from the dropdown to upgrade the md.

- Scale the replicas: In the popup dialog, you can increase or decrease the number of worker nodes that are managed by this machine deployment. Either specify the number of desired nodes or use the `+` or `-` to increase or decrease node count.

![Update EKS Machine Deployment](/img/kubermatic/main/tutorials/external_clusters/edit_eks_md.png "Update EKS Machine Deployment")

## Delete Cluster

{{% notice info %}}
Delete operation is not allowed for imported clusters.
{{% /notice %}}

Delete cluster operation allows to delete the cluster from the Provider. Click on the `Delete` button.

 "Delete Cluster")

## Delete the Node Group

Navigate to the cluster overview, scroll down to machine deployments and click on the delete icon next to the machine deployment you want to delete.

### Authenticating with EKS

The KKP platform allows getting kubeconfig file for the EKS cluster. The end-user must be aware that the kubeconfig expires
after some short period of time.
It's recommended to create your kubeconfig file with the AWS CLI.

#### Configure AWS credentials

The AWS CLI uses credentials and configuration settings located in multiple places, such as the system or user environment
variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on the command line as a parameter.

The AWS CLI stores sensitive credential information that you specify with aws configure in a local file named credentials,
in a folder named `.aws` in your home directory. The less sensitive configuration options that you specify with aws configure
are stored in a local file named `config`, also stored in the `.aws` folder in your home directory.

Example:

`~/.aws/credentials`

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

#### Create kubeconfig file

Now you can create kubeconfig file automatically ussing the following command:

```
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region region-code --name cluster-name
```

By default, the resulting configuration file is created at the default kubeconfig path (.kube/config) in your home directory
or merged with an existing kubeconfig file at that location. You can specify another path with the `--kubeconfig` option.
