Through KKP you can set up automatic scheduled etcd backups for your user clusters, and easily restore etcd to its previous state.

Firstly, you need to enable and configure at least one backup destination (backup bucket, endpoint and credentials). To see how, check [Etcd Backup Destination Settings]({{< ref "../administration/admin-panel/backup-buckets" >}}).

It is recommended to enable [EtcdLauncher]({{< ref "../../cheat-sheets/etcd/etcd-launcher" >}}) on the clusters.
It is _required_ for the restore to work.

## Etcd Backups

When the etcd backups are configured for a seed, project admins can create automatic Etcd Backups for the project clusters.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubermatic.k8c.io/v1
kind: EtcdBackupConfig
metadata:
  name: daily-backup
  namespace: cluster-zvc78xnnz7
spec:
  cluster:
    apiVersion: kubermatic.k8c.io/v1
    kind: Cluster
    name: zvc78xnnz7
  schedule: '@every 20m'
  keep: 20
  destination: s3
```

Once created, the controller will start a new backup every time the schedule demands it (i.e. at 1:00 AM in the example),
and delete backups once more than `.spec.keep` (20 in the example) have been created. The created backups are named based
on the configuration name and the backup timestamp `$backupconfigname-$timestamp`. The backup is stored at the specified backup destination,
which is configured per Seed.

The full specification for `EtcdBackupConfig` can be found in [the CRD documentation]({{< ref "../../references/crds/#etcdbackupconfig" >}}).
These resources can be either created via the UI (see below) or via `kubectl` directly.

It is also possible to do one-time backups (snapshots). The only change to the YAML example above for snapshots is omitting the
`schedule` key.

### Creating a Backup Schedule

EtcdBackups and Restores are project resources, and you can manage them in the Project view.

![Etcd Backups View](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/etcd-backups.png?classes=shadow,border "Project Etcd Backups")

To create a backup, just click on the `Add Automatic Backup` button. You have a choice of preset daily, weekly or monthly backups,
or you can create a backup with a custom interval and keep time. The destination dropdown is based on the configured backup destinations
for a given seed the cluster belongs to.

### Listing Backups

To see what backups are available, click on a backup you are interested in, and you will see a list of completed backups.

![Etcd Backups Details List](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/backups-list.png?classes=shadow,border "Etcd Backups Details")

Alternatively, the list of backups is also published to the `EtcdBackupConfig` and can be fetched from the object's status
subresource via `kubectl`. It would look like this:

```yaml
status:
  lastBackups:
  - backupFinishedTime: "2021-03-16T01:48:22Z"
    backupName: zvc78xnnz7-jobtest1-2021-03-16T03:48:00
    backupPhase: Completed
    deleteFinishedTime: "2021-03-16T02:01:43Z"
    deleteJobName: zvc78xnnz7-backup-jobtest1-delete-s8sb8mdsp5
    deletePhase: Completed
    jobName: zvc78xnnz7-backup-jobtest1-create-rjjq9d4k6d
    scheduledTime: "2021-03-16T01:48:00Z"
  - backupFinishedTime: "2021-03-16T01:51:25Z"
    backupName: zvc78xnnz7-jobtest1-2021-03-16T03:51:00
    backupPhase: Completed
    deleteFinishedTime: "2021-03-16T02:04:08Z"
    deleteJobName: zvc78xnnz7-backup-jobtest1-delete-wcwvc8nmdt
    deletePhase: Completed
    jobName: zvc78xnnz7-backup-jobtest1-create-96tblznngk
    scheduledTime: "2021-03-16T01:51:00Z"
  - backupFinishedTime: "2021-03-16T01:54:21Z"
    backupName: zvc78xnnz7-jobtest1-2021-03-16T03:54:00
    backupPhase: Completed
    deleteFinishedTime: "2021-03-16T02:08:24Z"
    deleteJobName: zvc78xnnz7-backup-jobtest1-delete-cgmqhlw5fw
    deletePhase: Completed
    jobName: zvc78xnnz7-backup-jobtest1-create-v2gz2ntn46
    scheduledTime: "2021-03-16T01:54:00Z"
```

### One-Time Backups

You can also create one-time backup snapshots, they are set up similarly to the automatic ones, with the difference that they do not
have a schedule or keep count set.

## Restoring from Backup

To restore a cluster etcd from a backup, go into a backup details as shown above and select the backup from which you want to restore.

What will happen is that the cluster will get paused, etcd will get deleted, and then recreated from the backup. When it's done, the cluster will unpause.

{{% notice note %}}
Keep in mind that this is an etcd backup and restore. The only thing that is restored is the etcd state, not application data or similar.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice note %}}
If you have running pods on the user cluster, which are not in the backup, it's possible that they will get orphaned.
Meaning that they will still run, even though etcd(and K8s) is not aware of them.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice note %}}
EtcdRestore can be marked with phase `EtcdLauncherNotEnabled`. You should
enable [EtcdLauncher]({{<ref "../../cheat-sheets/etcd/etcd-launcher" >}}) on the cluster for restore to proceed.
{{% /notice %}}

### Starting a Restore

If you want to restore from a specific backup, just click on the restore from backup icon.

![Etcd Backups Restore button](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/restore-backup.png?classes=shadow,border "Restore backup button")

![Etcd Backups Cluster Restore](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/restore-cluster.png?classes=shadow,border "Restore etcd backup for cluster")

This will create an `EtcdRestore` object for your cluster. You can observe the progress in the Restore list.

![Etcd Restore List](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/etcd-restores-list.png?classes=shadow,border "Etcd Restore List")


#### Starting Restore via kubectl

To restore a cluster from am existing backup via `kubectl`, you simply create a restore resource in the cluster namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubermatic.k8c.io/v1
kind: EtcdRestore
metadata:
  name: cluster-restore
  namespace: cluster-zvc78xnnz7
spec:
  cluster:
    apiVersion: kubermatic.k8c.io/v1
    kind: Cluster
    name: zvc78xnnz7
  backupName: daily-backup-2021-03-02T15:24:00
  destination: s3
```

This needs to reference the backup name from the list of backups (shown above).


### Restore Progress

In the cluster view, you may notice that your cluster is in a `Restoring` state, and you can not interact with it until it is done.

![Cluster Restoring](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/cluster-restoring.png?classes=shadow,border "Cluster Restoring")

When it's done, the cluster will get un-paused and un-blocked, so you can use it. The Etcd Restore will go into a Completed state.

![Etcd Restore Completed](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/restore-completed.png?classes=shadow,border "Etcd Restore Completed")

## Customization

By default, KKP uses container snippets to run pre-defined scripts that upload backups to and deletes them from an S3-compatible
storage.

They are configured in `KubermaticConfiguration` via:

- `.spec.seedController.backupDeleteContainer` for backup deletion.
- `.spec.seedController.backupStoreContainer` for backup file upload.

Their defaults can be reviewed [in the reference KubermaticConfiguration]({{< ref "../kkp-configuration/" >}}). Both containers
use the image `d3fk/s3cmd` to interact with S3-compatible storage. The configuration options mentioned above hold a full container
specification, which means that a fullÂ [container specification](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.27/#container-v1-core)
can be passed. This way uploads and deletions can be adjusted to individual needs. The dashboard and configuration objects expect
the default containers to be capable of handling S3 endpoints.
