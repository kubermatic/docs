## User Projects Limit

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/user_projects_limit.png?classes=shadow,border)

This setting controls how project creation will be handled by the Kubermatic. The administrator can control
if regular users should be able to create projects. There is also an option to control maximum number of projects
that regular users will be able to create. The `User Projects Limit` is controlled on a per-user basis and affects
only non-admin users.

## Resource Filter

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/resource_filter.png?classes=shadow,border)

Resource Filter settings provide an easy way to control the size of machines used to create user clusters. The administrator
can also control if selection of instances with GPU should be possible. Every node size that does not match the
specified criteria will be filtered out and not displayed to the user.
