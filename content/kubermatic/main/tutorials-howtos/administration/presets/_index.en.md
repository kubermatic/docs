{{% notice note %}}
Due to security considerations it will not be possible to read provider configuration after creation from the Dashboard.
It will only be possible to use and override it.
{{% /notice %}}

Presets give administrators the ability to predefine a set of provider information that can subsequently be used to speed up
the cluster creation process. Be aware that a single Preset can contain information about multiple providers.

As an example let's see what kind of information can be set for the AWS provider.
```yaml
aws:
  accessKeyID: '<accessKeyID>'
  secretAccessKey: '<secretAccessKey>'
  vpcID: '<vpcID>' // optional
  routeTableID: '<routeTableID>' // optional
  instanceProfileName: '<profileName>' // optional
  securityGroupID: '<securityGroupID>' // optional
  roleARN: '<roleARN>' // optional
```

## Managing Presets via the Dashboard

Thankfully, all this can be managed through the Admin Panel in the Kubermatic Dashboard. We'll shortly describe all the important
features and how to use the preset management.

### Checking Configured Presets

Preset list offers multiple options that allow Administrators to manage Presets.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/preset_management.png?height=300px&classes=shadow,border)

1. Create a new Preset
1. Manage existing Preset
    - Edit Preset (allows showing/hiding specific providers)
    - Add a new provider to the Preset
    - Edit configure provider
1. Show/Hide the Preset. Allows hiding Presets from the users and block new cluster creation based on them.
1. A list of providers configured for the Preset.


### Creating a Preset

Open the `Create Preset` dialog through the button available on the Preset list.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/create_preset.png?height=300px&classes=shadow,border)

#### Step 1: Preset

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/create_preset_first_step.png?height=500px&classes=shadow,border)

- `Name` is a required parameter and will be used in the wizard to select the provider.
- `Domain` is an optional parameter that allows to limit Preset availability only to the specific users with email matching this domain.
- `Projects` is an optional list of projects that allows to limit Preset availability to the specific projects.
- `Hide upon creation` allows to hide the preset after creation. The Preset can later be updated to be visible to users.

Email domain and project limitations "stack", which means that setting both fields will limit a Preset to be used
by users with the correct email domain but only within projects for which the Preset is allowed.

Note that project limitations can only be [edited from `kubectl`](#editing-a-preset) after creating a Preset.

#### Step 2: Provider

All configured providers will be available on this step and only a single provider can be selected.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/create_preset_second_step.png?height=500px&classes=shadow,border)

#### Step 3: Settings

The _Settings_ step will vary depending on the provider selected in the previous step. In our example, we have selected
an AWS provider.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/create_preset_third_step.png?height=500px&classes=shadow,border)

There are provider specific fields available here. Some of them will be mandatory as they are needed for the cluster
creation.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/create_preset_third_step_dc.png?height=200px&classes=shadow,border)

The `Restrict to Datacenter` field is available for all providers. It allows administrators to
restrict using the Preset to a single datacenter. Datacenter names can be found i.e. on the [Dynamic Datacenters]({{< ref "../admin-panel/dynamic-datacenters-management/_index.en.md" >}}) list.

{{% notice note %}}
Make sure to use actual datacenter names and not the display names that are used i.e. in the wizard while creating the clusters.
{{% /notice %}}

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/datacenter_names.png?height=300px&classes=shadow,border "Dynamic Datacenter Names")

### Adding a Provider to the Preset

Open `Add Provider` option through dotted menu on the Preset list entry. Note that it will only be available if not all
available providers were configured for the Preset.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/add_provider.png?height=300px&classes=shadow,border)

#### Step 1: Provider

Select a provider you would like to add to the Preset. In our example, we have selected an AWS provider. Note that every
provider can be configured only once for the Preset and only providers that are not already configured will appear on the list.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/add_provider_first_step.png?height=500px&classes=shadow,border)

#### Step 2: Settings

Provider specific fields will be available to fill out, same as during the Preset creation process.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/add_provider_second_step.png?height=500px&classes=shadow,border)

### Editing a Provider Preset

{{% notice note %}}
Updating a Provider Preset does not update credentials used by clusters already created
from said Preset.
{{% /notice %}}

Open `Edit Provider` option through dotted menu on the Preset list entry.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/edit_provider.png?height=250px&classes=shadow,border)

#### Step 1: Provider

Select a provider you would like to add to the Preset. In our example, we have selected an Openstack provider. Note that every
only already configured providers are available on the list.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/edit_provider_first_step.png?height=350px&classes=shadow,border)

#### Step 2: Settings

Provider specific fields will be available to fill out, same as during the Preset creation process.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/edit_provider_second_step.png?height=500px&classes=shadow,border)

### Showing/Hiding Providers Inside the Preset {#show-hide-provider-inside-the-preset}

Open `Edit Preset` option through dotted menu on the Preset list entry.

![](/img/kubermatic/main/ui/edit_preset.png?height=250px&classes=shadow,border)

This dialog allows managing the Preset status on a per-provider basis. In case only a specific provider should
be hidden/shown instead of hiding the whole Preset it can be managed here.

## Managing Presets via kubectl

While the Kubermatic Dashboard offers easy options to manage Presets, it is also possible to use `kubectl`
on the Master Cluster to manage them. This can be useful for automation (e.g. GitOps workflows).

{{% notice warning %}}
Since Presets can contain sensitive information, ensure that access to `Preset` resources is limited to KKP administrators.
Credentials with RBAC access to them (e.g. by binding the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole) must not be provided to end users.
{{% /notice %}}

Presets are stored in the [`Preset` Custom Resource]({{< ref "../../../references/crds/#preset" >}}). Check out the full
CRD reference for details on all available fields.

### Checking Configured Presets

As Presets are Kubernetes API resources created by KKP CRDs, they can be interacted with via `kubectl` standard
operations, e.g. to list available Presets:

```bash
kubectl get presets
#NAME                     AGE
#my-preset                26h
#my-second-preset         21h
```

Configuration for specific presets can be viewed by providing the `-o yaml` flag:

```bash
kubectl get preset my-preset -o yaml
```

Output will look similar to the YAML provided below. This contains sensitive data (cloud provider credentials),
so be mindful of exposing the output of this command to others.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubermatic.k8c.io/v1
kind: Preset
metadata:
  name: my-preset
  # [...]
spec:
  digitalocean:
    token: do-token
  hetzner:
    token: hetzner-token
  enabled: true
  requiredEmails:
  - kubermatic.com
  projects:
  - abm95xj85g
```

The example Preset above configures DigitalOcean and Hetzner as providers, is active (`enabled`), requires users to
have an email address with `@kubermatic.com` and can only be used in a project with the ID `abm95xj85g`.
It is important to note that this is the project ID and not the "human-readable" name.

### Creating a Preset

Presets can also be created via `kubectl`. As with any other Kubernetes resource, you will need to draft a YAML file
for it and then create/apply it. The YAML example above can be re-used to start creating a `Preset` resource. For respective
fields for each provider, check out the [PresetSpec CRD reference]({{< ref "../../../references/crds/#presetspec" >}}).

Each provider implementation has different fields, but the `Preset` specification itself supports a few keys
that have already been mentioned above:

- `spec.enabled`: whether the Preset is shown to users in the Kubermatic Dashboard.
- `spec.requiredEmails`: A list of user email domains that this Preset is restricted to.
- `spec.projects`: A list of projects that this Preset is restricted to.

Each provider section, apart from provider-specific fields, also offers the following two keys:

- `spec.<provider>.enabled`: whether the specific provider in this Preset is shown to users in the Kubermatic Dashboard.
- `spec.<provider>.datacenter`: restricts this provider to a specific datacenter.

After finishing the YAML file, apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./preset.yaml
```

### Editing a Preset

As with other Kubernetes API resources, already created Presets can be edited with `kubectl`.

```bash
kubectl edit preset my-preset
```

This will open the editor configured for `kubectl edit` and let you update the YAML specification.
It is possible to update any fields already present or add/remove provider sections from the `Preset`.

## Limiting Permissions for Credentials used in Presets

For selected infrastructure providers it makes sense to limit the permissions of the credentials to protect against access creep.

{{< tabs name="Permissions" >}}
{{% tab name="AWS" %}}
For AWS no root is required and we recommend the following IAM policy:

```json
