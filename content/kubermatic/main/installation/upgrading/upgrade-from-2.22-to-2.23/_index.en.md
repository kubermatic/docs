{{% notice note %}}
Upgrading to KKP 2.23 is only supported from version 2.22. Do not attempt to upgrade from versions prior to that and apply the upgrade step by step over minor versions instead (e.g. from [2.21 to 2.22]({{< ref "../upgrade-from-2.21-to-2.22/" >}}) and then to 2.23). It is also strongly advised to be on the latest 2.22.x patch release before upgrading to 2.23.
{{% /notice %}}

This guide will walk you through upgrading Kubermatic Kubernetes Platform (KKP) to version 2.23. For the full list of changes in this release, please check out the [KKP changelog for v2.23](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/blob/main/docs/changelogs/CHANGELOG-2.23.md). Please read the full document before proceeding with the upgrade.

## TODO: Pre-Upgrade Considerations

KKP 2.23 adjusts the list of supported Kubernetes versions and drops a couple of Kubernetes releases without upstream support. Support for Kubernetes XXXXXX and below has been removed. As such, all user clusters should be upgraded to Kubernetes YYYYY.

### Velero 1.10

[Velero](https://velero.io/) has been upgraded from v1.9.x to 1.10.x. During this change, Velero improved backups by adding support for kopia for doing file-system level backups (in addition to the existing restic support). The KKP Helm chart continues to be configured for restic.

Please refer to the [Velero 1.10 Upgrade Notes](https://velero.io/docs/v1.10/upgrade-to-1.10/) for more information if you want to switch to kopia or have customized Velero in any other way.

## Upgrade Procedure

Before starting the upgrade, make sure your KKP Master and Seed clusters are healthy with no failing or pending Pods. If any Pod is showing problems, investigate and fix the individual problems before applying the upgrade. This includes the control plane components for user clusters, unhealthy user clusters should not be submitted to an upgrade.

### KKP Master Upgrade

Download the latest 2.23.x release archive for the correct edition (`ce` for Community Edition, `ee` for Enterprise Edition) from [the release page](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases) and extract it locally on your computer. Make sure you have the `values.yaml` you used to deploy KKP 2.21 available and already adjusted for any 2.23 changes (also see [Pre-Upgrade Considerations](#pre-upgrade-considerations)), as you need to pass it to the installer. The `KubermaticConfiguration` is no longer necessary (unless you are adjusting it), as the KKP operator will use its in-cluster representation. From within the extracted directory, run the installer:

```sh
$ ./kubermatic-installer deploy kubermatic-master --helm-values path/to/values.yaml

```

Upgrading seed clusters is not necessary, unless you are running the `minio` Helm chart or User Cluster MLA as distributed by KKP on them. They will be automatically upgraded by KKP components.

You can follow the upgrade process by either supervising the Pods on master and seed clusters (by simply checking `kubectl get pods -n kubermatic` frequently) or checking status information for the `Seed` objects. A possible command to extract the current status by seed would be:

```sh
$ kubectl get seeds -A -o jsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name} - {.status}{'\n'}{end}"
kubermatic - {"clusters":5,"conditions":{"ClusterInitialized":{"lastHeartbeatTime":"2023-02-16T10:53:34Z","message":"All KKP CRDs have been installed successfully.","reason":"CRDsUpdated","status":"True"},"KubeconfigValid":{"lastHeartbeatTime":"2023-02-14T16:50:09Z","reason":"KubeconfigValid","status":"True"},"ResourcesReconciled":{"lastHeartbeatTime":"2023-02-14T16:50:14Z","reason":"ReconcilingSuccess","status":"True"}},"phase":"Healthy","versions":{"cluster":"v1.24.10","kubermatic":"v2.23.0"}}
```

Of particular interest to the upgrade process is if the `ResourcesReconciled` condition succeeded and if the `versions.kubermatic` field is showing the target KKP version. If this is not the case yet, the upgrade is still in flight. If the upgrade is stuck, try `kubectl -n kubermatic describe seed <seed name>` to see what exactly is keeping the KKP Operator from updating the Seed cluster.
