title = "Benchmark on Kubernetes 1.33 with KKP 2.28.3"
date = 2025-09-22T18:43:06+02:00
+++

This guide helps you evaluate the security of a Kubernetes cluster created using KKP against each control in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.

Please note: It is impossible to inspect the master nodes of managed clusters since from within the cluster(kubeconfig) one does not have access to such nodes. So for KKP, we can only check the worker nodes.

This guide corresponds to the following versions of KKP, CIS Benchmarks, and Kubernetes:

| KKP Version  | Kubernetes Version | CIS Benchmark Version |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 2.28.3               | 1.33.5                 | CIS-1.23                    |

## Testing Methodology

### Running the Benchmark

[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) was used to run the benchmark.

```bash
trivy k8s --compliance=k8s-cis-1.23 --report summary --timeout=1h --tolerations node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane="":NoSchedule
```

### Results

Summary Report for compliance: CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks v1.23

Each control in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark was evaluated. These are the possible results for each control:

游릭 **Pass:** The cluster passes the audit/control outlined in the benchmark.

游댯 **Pass (Additional Configuration Required):** The cluster passes the audit/control outlined in the benchmark with some extra configuration. The documentation is provided.

游댮 **Fail:** The audit/control will be fixed in a future KKP release.
