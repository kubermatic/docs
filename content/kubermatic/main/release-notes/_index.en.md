## [v2.XX.0](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/releases/tag/v2.XX.0)

Before upgrading, make sure to read the [general upgrade guidelines](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.XX/installation/upgrading/). Consider tweaking `seedControllerManager.maximumParallelReconciles` to ensure user cluster reconciliations will not cause resource exhaustion on seed clusters. A [full upgrade guide is available from the official documentation](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/v2.XX/installation/upgrading/upgrade-from-2.WW-to-2.XX/).
