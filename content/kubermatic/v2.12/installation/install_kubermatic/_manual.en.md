{{% notice warning %}}
With [Cleanup kubermatic-installer repo](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/5026) the installer repository is no longer public available.
This installation manual is kept for reference and those who have access to the installer repository.
{{% /notice %}}

### Clone the Installer

Clone the [installer repository](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic-installer) to your disk and make sure to
checkout the appropriate release branch (`release/vX.Y`). The latest stable release is already the default branch,
so in most cases there should be no need to switch. Alternatively you can also download a ZIP version from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic-installer
cd kubermatic-installer
```

### Creating the kubeconfig

The Kubermatic API lives inside the master cluster and therefore speaks to it via in-cluster communication, using the
`kubermatic` service account. Communication with the seed clusters happens by providing the API with a kubeconfig that
has the required contexts and credentials for each seed cluster. The name of the context within the kubeconfig needs to
match an entry within the `datacenters.yaml` (see below) and needs to be a valid DNS part. Kubermatic uses DNS records
like `*.[seed-name].[main-domain]`, so context names like `user@seed1` would not work. Make sure the seed names are
alphanumeric.

Also make sure your kubeconfig contains *static*, long-lived credentials. Some cloud providers use custom authentication
providers (like GKE using `gcloud` and EKS using `aws-iam-authenticator`). Those will not work in Kubermatic's usecase
because the required tools are not installed. You can use the `kubeconfig-serviceaccounts.sh` script from the
`kubermatic-installer` repository to automatically create proper service accounts inside each cluster and update the
kubeconfig file.

{{%expand "Sample kubeconfig"%}}

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: AAAAAA
    server: https://seed-1.kubermatic.de:6443
  name: seed-1
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: AAAAAA
    server: https://seed-2.kubermatic.de:6443
  name: seed-2
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: seed-1
    user: seed-1
  name: seed-1
- context:
    cluster: seed-2
    user: seed-2
  name: seed-2
current-context: seed-1
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: seed-1
  user:
    token: very-secure-token
- name: seed-2
  user:
    token: very-secure-token
```

{{%/expand%}}

In the example above, we define two possible seed identifiers for the `datacenters.yml`: `seed-1` and `seed-2`.

### Defining the Datacenters

See: [Datacenters]({{< ref "../../concepts/datacenters" >}})

### Creating the Master Cluster `values.yaml`

Installation of Kubermatic uses the [Kubermatic Installer](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic-installer), which is
essentially a Kubernetes job with [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and the required charts to install Kubermatic and its
associated resources. Customization of the cluster configuration is done using a cluster-specific `values.yaml`, stored
as a secret within the cluster.

As a reference you can check out
[values.example.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic-installer/blob/release/v2.8/values.example.yaml).

For the kubermatic configuration you need to add `base64` encoded configuration of `datacenter.yaml` and `kubeconfig` to
the `values.yaml` file. You can do this with following command:

```bash
base64 kubeconfig | tr -d '\n'
```

#### Kubermatic & System Services Authentication

Access to Kibana, Grafana and all other system services included with Kubermatic is secured by running them behind
[Keycloak-Gatekeeper](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-gatekeeper) and using [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex)
as the authentication provider. Dex can then be configured to use external authentication sources like GitHub's or
Google's OAuth endpoint, LDAP or OpenID Connect. Kubermatic itself makes use of Dex as well, but since it supports OAuth
natively does not make use of Keycloak-Gatekeeper.

For this to work you have to configure both Dex and Keycloak-Gatekeeper (called "IAP", Identity-Aware Proxy) in your
`values.yaml`.

{{% notice note %}}
It is still possible to access the system services by using `kubectl port-forward` and thereby circumventing the
authentication entirely.
{{% /notice %}}

##### Dex

{{% notice note %}}
Please note that despite its name, Dex is part of the `oauth` Helm chart.
{{% /notice %}}

For each service that is supposed to use Dex as an authentication provider, configure a `client`. The callback URL is
called after authentication has been completed and must point to `https://<domain>/oauth/callback`. Remember that this
will point to Keycloak-Gatekeeper and is therefore independent of the actual underlying application. Generate a secure
random secret for each client as well.

A sample configuration for Prometheus could look like this:

```yaml
dex:
  clients:
  - id: prometheus # a unique identifier
    name: Prometheus
    secret: very-very-very-secret # clientSecret
    # list of allowed redirect URIs
    # (which one is used is determined by what Keycloak-Proxy decides)
    RedirectURIs:
    - https://kubermatic.example.company.com/oauth/callback
```

Each service should have its own credentials. See the `dex` section in the [example
values.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic-installer/blob/release/v2.11/values.example.yaml).

##### Alternative Authentication provider

If you don't use Dex as authentication provider, see [OIDC provider Configuration](../../../advanced/oidc_config/) you will need to configure for every service a dedicated redirect URI:
Each service should have its own credentials. This means that is required to create an OAuth App with redirects for every service:

* kubermatic
  - `https://kubermatic.example.company.com`
  - `https://kubermatic.example.company.com/projects`
* kubermaticIssuer
  - `https://kubermatic.example.company.com/api/v1/kubeconfig`
* Grafana
  - `https://grafana.kubermatic.example.company.com/oauth/callback`
* Kibana
  - `https://kibana.kubermatic.example.company.com/oauth/callback`
- Prometheus
  - `https://prometheus.kubermatic.example.company.com/oauth/callback`
  - `https://alertmanager.kubermatic.example.company.com/oauth/callback`

obviously, `kubermatic.example.company.com` should be replaces with your domain name.

##### Keycloak-Gatekeeper (IAP)

Now that you have setup your "virtual OAuth provider" in the form of Dex, you need to configure Keycloak-Gatekeeper
to sit in front of the system services and use it for authentication. For each client that we configured in Dex,
add a `deployment` to the IAP configuration. Use the client's secret (from Dex) as the `client_secret` and generate
another random, secure encryption key to encrypt the client state with (which is then stored as a cookie in the user's
browser).

A sample deployment for Prometheus could look like this:

```yaml
iap:
  deployments:
    prometheus:
      name: prometheus # will be used to create kubernetes Deployment object

      # OAuth configuration from Dex
      client_id: prometheus
      client_secret: very-very-very-secret

      # encryption key for cookie storage
      encryption_key: ultra-secret-random-value

      ## see https://github.com/gambol99/keycloak-proxy#configuration
      ## example configuration allowing access only to the mygroup from
      ## mygithuborg organization
      config:
        scopes:
        - "groups"
        resources:
        - uri: "/*"
          groups:
          - "mygithuborg:mygroup"

      upstream_service: prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local
      upstream_port: 9999
      ingress:
        host: prometheus.kubermatic.example.company.com
```

See the `iap` section in the [example
values.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic-installer/blob/release/v2.8/values.example.yaml) for more
information.

### Providing Storage

A storage class with the name `kubermatic-fast` needs to exist within the cluster. Also, make sure to either have a
default storage class defined or configure Minio in your `values.yaml` to use a specific one:

```yaml
minio:
  storageClass: hdd-disk
```

An explicit storage class to AWS using SSDs can look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: kubermatic-fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: gp2
```

Store the above YAML snippet in a file and then apply it using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f aws-storageclass.yaml
```

Please consult the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#parameters)
for more information about the possible parameters for your storage backend.

### Create All CustomResourceDefinitions

Before applying the Helm charts, ensure that Kubermatic's CRDs are installed in your cluster by applying the provided
manifests:

```bash
kubectl apply -f charts/kubermatic/crd
```

### cert-manager

To properly install the cert-manager, you need to manually label its namespace or else the included webhook will not
function correctly and your cluster will not be able to request certificates. Make sure to create your desired namespace
and then label it like so:

```bash
kubectl create namespace cert-manager
kubectl label namespace cert-manager certmanager.k8s.io/disable-validation=true
```

### Deploying the Helm Charts

Install [Helm](https://www.helm.sh/) on you local system and setup Tiller within the cluster.

1. Create a service account for Tiller and bind it to the `cluster-admin` role:

   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace kubermatic
   kubectl create serviceaccount -n kubermatic tiller
   kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-role --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kubermatic:tiller
   ```

1. Afterwards install Tiller with the correct service account:

   ```bash
   helm --service-account tiller --tiller-namespace kubermatic init
   ```

Now you're ready to deploy Kubermatic and its charts. It's generally advisable to postpone installing the final `certs`
chart until you acquired LoadBalancer IPs/hostnames and can update your DNS zone to point to your new installation. This
ensures that the `cert-manager` can quickly acquire TLS certificates instead of running into DNS issues.

{{% notice note %}}
On your very first installation, you must install the Kubermatic chart with `kubermatic.checks.crd.disable=true`. This
disables a check that was put in place for upgrading older Kubermatic versions to the current one.
{{% /notice %}}

```bash
helm upgrade --tiller-namespace kubermatic --install --wait --timeout 300 --values values.yaml --namespace nginx-ingress-controller nginx-ingress-controller charts/nginx-ingress-controller/

# if you deployed Minio in another namespace than "minio", make sure to adjust s3Exporter.endpoint in the values.yaml
helm upgrade --tiller-namespace kubermatic --install --wait --timeout 300 --values values.yaml --namespace kube-system s3-exporter charts/s3-exporter/

# cluster backups (etcd and volumes) (requires proper configuration in the chart's values.yaml)
helm upgrade --tiller-namespace kubermatic --install --wait --timeout 300 --values values.yaml --namespace velero velero charts/backup/velero/
```

After all charts have been deployed, update your DNS accordingly. See the last section on this page for more details.
Once that is done, wait a bit and then install the final Helm chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --tiller-namespace kubermatic --install --wait --timeout 300 --values values.yaml --namespace default certs charts/certs/
```

### etcd Backups

We run an individual cronjob every 20 minutes for each customer cluster to backup the etcd-ring. Snapshots will be
stored by default to an internal S3 bucket provided by minio, though this can be changed by modifying the
`storeContainer` & `cleanupContainer` in the `values.yaml` to your needs.

The cronjobs will be executed in the `kube-system` namespace. Therefore if a container needs credentials, a secret must
be created in the kube-system namespace.

The workflow:

1. init-container creates snapshot
1. snapshot will be saved in a shared volume
1. `storeContainer` takes the snapshot and stores it somewhere

#### storeContainer

The `storeContainer` will be executed on each backup process after a snapshot has been created and stored on a shared
volume accessible by the container. By default only the last 20 revisions will be kept. Older snapshots will be deleted.
By default the container will store the snapshot to minio.

#### cleanupContainer

The `cleanupContainer` will delete all snapshots in S3 after a cluster has been deleted.

#### Credentials

If the default container will be used, a secret named `s3-credentials` in the `kube-system` namespace must be created:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: s3-credentials
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  ACCESS_KEY_ID: "SOME_BASE64_ENCODED_ACCESS_KEY"
  SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "SOME_BASE64_ENCODED_SECRET_KEY"
```

### Create DNS Entries

Kubermatic needs to have at least 2 DNS entries set.

#### Dashboard, API, Dex

The frontend of Kubermatic needs a single, simple DNS entry. Let's assume it is being installed to serve
`kubermatic.example.company.com`. For the system services like Prometheus or Grafana, you will also want to create a wildcard
DNS record `*.kubermatic.example.company.com` pointing to the same IP/hostname.

##### With LoadBalancer

When running on a cloud provider which supports services of type
[LoadBalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer), the nginx-ingress chart
should be configured to create such a service. The load balancer's IP can then be fetched via:

```bash
kubectl -n nginx-ingress-controller get service nginx-ingress-controller -o wide
#NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE       SELECTOR
#nginx-ingress-controller   LoadBalancer   10.47.242.69   35.198.146.37   80:30822/TCP,443:31412/TCP   160d      app=ingress-nginx
```

The `EXTERNAL-IP` field shows the correct IP used for the DNS entry. Depending on your provider, this might also be a
hostname, in which case you should set a CNAME record instead of an A record.

##### Without LoadBalancer

Without a LoadBalancer nginx will run as DaemonSet & allocate 2 ports on the host (80 & 443). Configuration of nginx
happens via the [values.yaml](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic-installer/blob/release/v2.8/values.example.yaml).
The DNS entry needs to be configured to point to one or more of the cluster nodes.

#### Seed Clusters (Customer-Cluster Apiservers)

For each seed cluster a single wildcard DNS entry must be configured. All apiservers of all customer clusters are being
exposed via either NodePorts or a single LoadBalancer.

The domain will be based on the name of the seed-cluster as defined in the
[datacenters.yaml](https://docs.kubermatic.io/installation/install_kubermatic/#defining-the-datacenters) and the domain
under which the frontend is available.

For example, when the base domain is `kubermatic.example.company.com` and a seed cluster in your `datacenters.yaml` is called
`europe-west1`, then

* The seed cluster domain would be: `europe-west1.kubermatic.example.company.com`
* The corresponding wildcard entry would be: `*.europe-west1.kubermatic.example.company.com`

A customer cluster created in this seed cluster would get the domain `[cluster ID].europe-west1.kubermatic.example.com`.

##### With LoadBalancer

Get the IP from the `nodeport-lb` service:

```bash
kubectl -n nodeport-proxy get service nodeport-lb
#NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                                                           AGE
#nodeport-lb   LoadBalancer   10.47.242.236   35.198.93.90   32493:30195/TCP,31434:30739/TCP,30825:32503/TCP,30659:30324/TCP   93d
```

##### Without LoadBalancer

Take one or more of the seed cluster worker nodes IPs.
