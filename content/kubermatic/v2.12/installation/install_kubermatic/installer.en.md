Using the installer is the recommended way of installing Kubermatic Kubernetes Platform (KKP) into your cluster. It provides a simple web wizard for configuration and automates the installation of all required components.

At the moment you need to be invited to get access to KKP's Docker registry before you can try it out. Please [contact sales](mailto:sales@kubermatic.com) to receive your credentials.

## Quickstart

The installer is available via Docker and can be run by

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 quay.io/kubermatic/installer wizard
```

and then opening [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. Follow the steps and you should be up and running in no time.

{{% notice note %}}
Because the installer runs inside a Docker container, it cannot access any cluster authentication providers on your host machine, like Amazon's `aws-iam-authenticator`. Make sure to provide static credentials in your `kubeconfig` or use the `kubeconfig-serviceaccounts.sh` script to automatically add static accounts to your clusters (see [credentials](#credentials) section below).

If you feel more comfortable with using Helm, you can also use the installer to only create the `values.yaml` for you and the continue to use Helm for the actual installation.

In any case, make sure to download the installer manifest and the `values.yaml` when you're done, so you can easily restart the installer at a later point to upgrade KKP.

## Credentials

Because the Docker image cannot access your local development toolset, you need to provide static credentials in your `kubeconfig` to the installer. The recommended approach is to create a service account in your cluster that has `cluster-admin` permissions and then use this account's token for authentication.

To aid in this process, the [installer repository](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic-installer) contains a `kubeconfig-serviceaccounts.sh` script that will automate the process. Create a copy of your `~/.kube/config` and then call the script like so:

```bash
./kubeconfig-serviceaccounts.sh mykubeconfig
```

The script will update the file in-place. Afterwards you can copy&paste the file into the installer.

## Pre-Requisites

Your cluster needs to have a storage class `kubermatic-fast` defined. The installer can automatically create a class that is backed by SSD storage with the provider's default settings, but in case you need further customizations, create it before running the installer.

## Limitations

Please note the following limitations in the current installer:

* You cannot run KKP in KKP.
* The `kubeconfig` needs to contain exactly one cluster and context.
* It's not yet possible to automatically install separate master and seed clusters.
* Your cluster needs to have a `kubermatic-fast` storage class already existing **or** run on GKE, EKS or ASK.
* Because we install Tiller in the `kubermatic` namespace, the `kubeconfig` needs `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You need publicly reachable hosts and be able to point DNS records to them in order for KKP to acquire TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt.

We are working on removing these limitations in the future.
