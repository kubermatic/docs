## KubeVirt
Once KubeVirt is installed as what the [official documentation](https://kubevirt.io/quickstart_cloud/) guides, a few
steps should be followed in order to use KubeVirt with KKP.

### StorageClass Requirements 
KKP uses [Containerized Data Importer](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer) (CDI) to import images and 
provision volumes to launch the VMs. CDI provides the ability to populate PVCs with VM images or other data upon creation. 
The data can come from different sources: a URL, a container registry, another PVC (clone), or an upload from a client.
For more information about the requirements of Kubernetes in general and CDI in specific, please follow the documentation
for PV,PVC and DV [here](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer/blob/master/doc/basic_pv_pvc_dv.md).

### KubeVirt Operator and Containerized Data Importer Version
KKP supports KubeVirt Operator >= 0.19.0 and the Containerized Data Importer >= v1.19.0. There are no hard requirements 
to run KubeVirt, however a Kubernetes cluster consists of 3 nodes with 2 CPUs, 4GB of RAM and 30GB of storage, to have a 
minimal installation.

### Use KKP with KubeVirt 
In order to allow KKP to provision VMs(worker nodes) in KubeVirt, users provide the kubeconfig of the Kubernetes cluster 
where the KubeVirt cluster is running. Users can add the content of the kubeconfig file in the third step of the cluster
creation. The content should be base64 encoded. 
 
### KKP MachineDeployment Sample
Here is a sample of a MachineDeployment that can be used to provision a VM:

```yaml
apiVersion: "cluster.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
kind: MachineDeployment
metadata:
  name: my-kubevirt-machine
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  paused: false
  replicas: 1
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  minReadySeconds: 0
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: my-kubevirt-machine
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: my-kubevirt-machine
    spec:
      providerSpec:
        value:
          sshPublicKeys:
            - "<< YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY >>"
          cloudProvider: "kubevirt"
          cloudProviderSpec:
            storageClassName: "<< YOUR_STORAGE_CLASS_NAME >>"
            pvcSize: "10Gi"
            sourceURL: 
            cpus: "1"
            memory: "2048M"
            kubeconfig:
              value: '<< KUBECONFIG >>'
            namespace: kube-system
          operatingSystem: "ubuntu"
          operatingSystemSpec:
            distUpgradeOnBoot: false
            disableAutoUpdate: true
      versions:
        kubelet: "1.18.10"
```
