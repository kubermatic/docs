## Helm Charts

### cert-manager

Kubermatic Kubernetes Platform (KKP) 2.12 ships with cert-manager 0.10, which changed the api versions for its manifests. This requires
manual intervention and a short time frame where no certificates can be created when upgrading. Before upgrading,
create a backup of all cert-manager resources (certificates, issuers, ...) because their CRDs will have to be
recreated.

After creating the backup, delete the cert-manager chart, delete the CRDs and re-install the chart (which also
re-installs the CRDs):

```bash
helm --tiller-namespace kubermatic-installer delete --purge cert-manager
kubectl get crd | awk '/certmanager/ {print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete crd

cd kubermatic-installer/charts/cert-manager
helm --tiller-namespace kubermatic-installer upgrade --install --namespace cert-manager --values YOUR_VALUES_YAML_HERE cert-manager .
```

### Velero

The default backup schedules for the `monitoring`, `logging` and `minio` namespaces have been removed. In order
to continue these backups, dump the schedules and re-import them after updating the Helm chart like so:

```bash
kubectl -n velero get schedules.velero.io -o yaml > schedules.yaml
helm --tiller-namespace kubermatic-installer upgrade --install --namespace velero --values YOUR_VALUES_YAML_HERE velero config/backup/velero
kubectl apply -f schedules.yaml
```

This change does not affect user cluster etcds, which are stilled backed up regularly.


### CNI

In v2.12, we are upgrading Flannel to v0.11.0 which lead to NetworkPolicies not working properly.
Flannel doesn't detect some iptables rules and flush the appropriate rules.

To avoid any failures on the cluster, you need to apply on each node of the
user clusters the following two commands, assuming the Pods CIDR is 172.25.0.0/16:

```bash
iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s 172.25.0.0/16 ! -d 224.0.0.0/4 -j MASQUERADE
iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING ! -s 172.25.0.0/16 -d 172.25.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
```
