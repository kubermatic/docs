- Add feature gate to enable etcd corruption check
- Remove Kubernetes 1.10 as officially supported version from KKP as it is EOL
- Add short names to the ClusterAPI CRDs to allow using `kubectl get md` for `machinedeployments`, `kubectl get ms` for `machinesets` and `kubectl get ma` to get `machines`
- Update canal to v2.6.12, Kubernetes Dashboard to v1.10.1 and replace kube-dns with CoreDNS 1.3.1
- Update Vertical Pod Autoscaler to v0.5
- Stop using the name "kubermatic" for cloud provider resources visible to end users
- Deploy the node-exporter by default as an addon into user clusters to provide Grafana dashboards for user cluster resource usage
- Make the default AMI's for AWS instances configurable via the `datacenters.yaml`
