## Supported KKP Versions

KKP versions are expressed as x.y.z, where x is the major version, y is the
minor version, and z is the patch version.

KKP follows the Kubernetes release model and cycle, though for practical reasons
releases are a bit delayed to ensure compatibility with Kubernetes. In general,
the latest three minor versions of KKP are supported, i.e. 2.19, 2.18 and 2.17.
With the release of a new minor KKP version, support for the oldest supported
KKP version is dropped.
