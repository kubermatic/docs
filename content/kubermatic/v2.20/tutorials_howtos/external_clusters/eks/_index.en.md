## Add EKS Cluster

You can add an existing Kubernetes cluster and then manage it using KKP.
From the `Clusters` page, click `External Clusters`. Click the `Add External Cluster` button and pick `Elastic Kubernetes Engine` provider.

Select preset with valid credentials or enter EKS `Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key` , and `Region` to connect to the provider.

You should see the list of all available clusters in the region specified. Select the one and click the `Import Cluster` button. Clusters can be imported only once in a single project. The same cluster can be imported for the other projects.

## Cluster Details Page

After the cluster is added, the KKP controller retrieves the cluster kubeconfig to display all necessary information.
A healthy cluster has `Running` state. Otherwise, the cluster can be in the `Error` state. Move the mouse cursor over the state indicator to get more details.

You can also click on `Machine Deployments` to get the details:

## Update Cluster

### Upgrade Version

To upgrade, click on the little dropdown arrow beside the `Control Plane Version` on the clusterâ€™s page and specify the version. For more details about EKS available Kubernetes versions
[Amazon EKS Kubernetes versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html "Amazon EKS Kubernetes versions")

If the upgrade version provided is valid, the cluster state will change to `Reconciling`

### Scale the Machine Deployment

Navigate to the cluster overview, scroll down to machine deployments and click on the edit icon next to the machine deployment you want to edit.

In the popup dialog, you can now increase or decrease the number of worker nodes that are managed by this machine deployment.

Either specify the number of desired nodes or use the `+` or `-` to increase or decrease node count.

### Authenticating with EKS

The KKP platform allows getting kubeconfig file for the EKS cluster. The end-user must be aware that the kubeconfig expires
after some short period of time.
It's recommended to create your kubeconfig file with the AWS CLI.

#### Configure AWS credentials

The AWS CLI uses credentials and configuration settings located in multiple places, such as the system or user environment
variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on the command line as a parameter.

The AWS CLI stores sensitive credential information that you specify with aws configure in a local file named credentials,
in a folder named `.aws` in your home directory. The less sensitive configuration options that you specify with aws configure
are stored in a local file named `config`, also stored in the `.aws` folder in your home directory.

Example:

`~/.aws/credentials`

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

#### Create kubeconfig file

Now you can create kubeconfig file automatically ussing the following command:

```
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region region-code --name cluster-name
```

By default, the resulting configuration file is created at the default kubeconfig path (.kube/config) in your home directory
or merged with an existing kubeconfig file at that location. You can specify another path with the `--kubeconfig` option.
