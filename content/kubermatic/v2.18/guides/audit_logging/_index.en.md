Audit Logging is one of the key security features provided by Kubernetes. Once enabled in the Kubernetes API server, it provides a chronological record of operations performed on the cluster by users, administrators and other cluster components.

Audit logging is also a key requirement of the [Kubernetes CIS benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/).

For more details, you can refer to the [upstream documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/).

### Kubermatic Kubernetes Platform (KKP) Support
KKP provides two levels of support for the Audit Logging:

* Audit Logging on user-cluster level
* Audit Logging on a datacenter level

{{% notice note %}}
Kubernetes Audit Logging is optional and is not enabled by default, since it requires additional memory and storage resources, depending on the specific configuration used.
{{% /notice %}}

Audit logs, if enabled, are emitted by a sidecar container called `audit-logs` in the `kubernetes-apiserver` Pods on the [Seed Cluster]({{< ref "../../architecture/#seed-cluster" >}}) in your cluster namespace. Setting up [the MLA stack on Master / Seed]({{< ref "../monitoring_logging_alerting/master_seed/installation" >}}) will allow storing the audit logs alongside other Pod logs collected by the MLA stack.

Initially, KKP will set up a minimal [Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/#audit-policy):

```yaml
{{< readfile "kubermatic/v2.18/data/policy.yaml">}}
```

This file is stored in a ConfigMap named `audit-config` on the [Seed Cluster]({{< ref "../../architecture/#seed-cluster" >}}) in your cluster namespace. To modify the default policy, you can edit this ConfigMap using `kubectl`:

```bash
$ kubectl edit -n cluster-<YOUR CLUSTER ID> configmap audit-config
```

#### User-Cluster Level Audit Logging

To enable user-cluster level Audit Logging, simply check `Audit Logging` in the KKP dashboard `Create Cluster` page:

![Create Cluster](01-create-cluster.png)

For exiting clusters, you can go to the cluster page, edit your cluster and enable (or disable) `Audit Logging`:

![Edit Cluster](01-edit-cluster.png)

#### Datacenter Level Audit Logging

KKP also supports enabling Audit Logging on the datacenter level. In this case, the option is enforced on all user-clusters in the datacenter. The user-cluster level flag is ignored in this case.

To enable this, you will need to edit your [datacenter definitions in a Seed]({{< ref "../../tutorials_howtos/administration/dynamic_data_centers/" >}}), and set `enforceAuditLogging` to `true` in the datacenter spec.
