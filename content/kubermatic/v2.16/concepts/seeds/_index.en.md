## Overview

The Seed CustomResourceDefinition replaces the legacy [`datacenters.yaml`]({{< ref "../datacenters" >}}) with
a more flexible, dynamic way of managing seed clusters. Seeds can be added and removed at runtime by simply
managing Seed resources inside the [master cluster]({{< ref "../architecture" >}}).

### Example Seed

The following is an example Seed, showing all possible options.

```yaml
{{< readfile "kubermatic/master/data/seed.yaml" >}}
```
