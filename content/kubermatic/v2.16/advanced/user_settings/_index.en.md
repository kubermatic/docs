### User Settings Overview

The user settings view is divided into two columns:
The left side contains all account details, such as the name and the email of the user, whereas the right side lists all possible settings that a user can make.

* `Items per page` will change the number of visible items per page in a table. It will be applied to all tables within KKP.
* `Theme` lists all available themes for the dashboard so the user can select its preferred one. Read chapter [Customizing the Dashboard Theme]({{< ref "../custom_ui" >}}) to learn more about themes.
* `Default Project` specifies which project should be opened by default. If selected, the user will automatically be redirected to the projects cluster view after login.

All settings changes are saved asynchronously, and the saves are confirmed by the green confirmation icons next to changed settings. Changes are automatically populated to all opened instances of the application.
