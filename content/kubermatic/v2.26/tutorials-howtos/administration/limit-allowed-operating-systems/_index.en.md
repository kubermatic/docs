This manual explains how to limit the allowed operating systems for a cluster via the UI. Allowed operating systems can be limited either at the global level or at the project level.

### Global Level

To limit the allowed operating systems at the global level, go to the `Admin panel` page:

## Project Level

To limit the allowed operating systems at the project level, you can edit the project from UI:

These settings are only for UI and will be applied during cluster creation and when adding/updating machine deployments.
