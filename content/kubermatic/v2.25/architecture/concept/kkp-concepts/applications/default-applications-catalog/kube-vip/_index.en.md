# What is Kube-VIP?

Kube-VIP provides Kubernetes clusters with a virtual IP and load balancer for both the control plane (for building a highly-available cluster) and Kubernetes Services of type LoadBalancer without relying on any external hardware or software.

For more information on the Kube-VIP, please refer to the [official documentation](https://kube-vip.io/)

# How to deploy?

Kube-VIP is available as part of the KKP's default application catalog. 
It can be deployed to the user cluster either during the cluster creation or after the cluster is ready(existing cluster) from the Applications tab via UI.

* Select the Kube-VIP application from the Application Catalog.
