## Overview

This page documents the list of known issues and possible work arounds/solutions.

## Latest Ubuntu 22.04 image prevents creating new EBS volumes on AWS

### Problem

The latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI (released on 30th July) prevents creating new EBS volumes on some AWS clusters.


### Root Cause

The latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI have IMDSv2 (the AWS instance metadata API) enabled as a default, while the previous Ubuntu AMIs allowed both IMDS v2 and v1. By default, the limit of hops of PUT requests to metadata service is 2. However, the default settings provided by AWS are not compatible with the containerized environments (i.e. Kubernetes) since the instance metadata service is not reachable from the container network in case if further hops are required. At this time, it appears that only Cilium clusters are affected, and only if the CSI components are running on nodes that are using the latest Ubuntu AMI.

### Solution

A new machine-controller (MC) version ([v1.58.6](https://github.com/kubermatic/machine-controller/releases/tag/v1.58.6)) has been released that can be configured into `KubermaticConfiguration`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubermatic.k8c.io/v1
kind: KubermaticConfiguration
metadata:
  name: kubermatic
  namespace: kubermatic
spec:
  userCluster:
    machineController:
      imageTag: v1.58.6
[...]
```

The updated MC version will be included in the next patch release (2.24.12).


## Recent Ubuntu 22.04 Image Fails to Bootstrap on Azure

### Problem

When using a recent (beginning of May 2024) Ubuntu 22.04 image provided by Azure, user cluster nodes provisioned by machine-controller and operating-system-manager fail to bootstrap and never join the cluster. Instead, the `bootstrap.service` systemd unit is constantly looping.

### Root Cause

A recent change to the Ubuntu 22.04 image has modified the configuration for `cloud-init` and how it accesses its datasource in Azure. `cloud-init clean` (which is used to prepare the machine for configuration as Kubernetes node) removes files crucial to this new way of communicating with the datasource and requires an additional step to recreate the missing configuration files.

### Solution

A new operating-system-manager (OSM) version ([v1.4.3](https://github.com/kubermatic/operating-system-manager/releases/tag/v1.4.3)) has been released that can be configured into `KubermaticConfiguration`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubermatic.k8c.io/v1
kind: KubermaticConfiguration
metadata:
  name: kubermatic
  namespace: kubermatic
spec:
  userCluster:
    operatingSystemManager:
      imageTag: v1.4.3
[...]
```

The updated OSM version will be included in the next patch release (2.24.9).

For custom OSPs the following change is relevant:

## User Cluster API Servers Fail to Start on Seed with Cilium CNI

### Problem

When upgrading to or installing KKP in version 2.24.0 or 2.24.1, kube-apiserver components fail to start with log output similar to the snippet below:

```json
{"level":"error","time":"2023-11-30T10:43:46.518Z","caller":"etcd-launcher/main.go:116","msg":"Operation failed: failed to initialize etcd cluster configuration: failed to get API group resources: unable to retrieve the complete list of server APIs: kubermatic.k8c.io/v1: Get \"https://10.96.0.1:443/apis/kubermatic.k8c.io/v1\": dial tcp 10.96.0.1:443: i/o timeout."}
```

This problem arises when Cilium is used as CNI for the underlying seed cluster.

It was fixed in KKP 2.24.2, see relevant issue: [kubermatic/kubermatic#12874](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/12874).

### Root Cause

A bug in Cilium tracked as [cilium/cilium#12277](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/12277) and [cilium/cilium#20550](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/20550).

Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` documentation [implies that allowing node access via CIDRs is supposed to work](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#what-you-can-t-do-with-network-policies-at-least-not-yet):

> Node specific policies (you can use CIDR notation for these, but you cannot target nodes by their Kubernetes identities specifically).

But Cilium does not properly allow traffic even though `NetworkPolicies` with node CIDRs are in place.

### Solution

For installations with KKP versions 2.24.0 or 2.24.1, there are two options available:

1. [Disable kube-apiserver NetworkPolicies in Seeds with Cilium as CNI]({{< ref "../../tutorials-howtos/networking/apiserver-policies/#in-a-seed-cluster" >}})
2. Manually creating a single `CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy` object (this is a cluster-scoped resource, i.e. global) to allow the erroneously blocked traffic:

```yaml
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: cilium-seed-apiserver-allow
spec:
  egress:
  - toEntities:
    - kube-apiserver
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: apiserver
```

For KKP 2.24.2 and higher, this policy is automatically created.

## Ubuntu 22.04 Cloud Image Issue on VMware Cloud Director

### Problem

The issue arises in Ubuntu 22.04 cloud image OVAs starting from version 20230602 when they are run on VMware Cloud Director. This problem disrupts the provisioning of new Kubernetes nodes using machine-controller due to interruptions caused by reboots.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue can be traced back to a change in the default settings of open-vm-tools. These changes, in turn, affect the behavior of cloud-init during startup, leading to the disruptive behavior observed when provisioning new Kubernetes nodes. Specifically, the open-vm-tools.service starts before cloud-init, and it runs with the default timeout (30 seconds).

### Solution

One interim [solution](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/issues/4188#issuecomment-1695041510) in this scenario is to create a custom Ubuntu 22.04 image with the following setting preconfigured
in /etc/vmware-tools/tools.conf file.
```
[deployPkg]
wait-cloudinit-timeout=0
```
This adjustment will help ensure that the issue no longer disrupts the provisioning of new Kubernetes nodes on the affected Ubuntu 22.04 cloud images running on VMware Cloud Director provider.

For additional details and discussions related to this issue, you can refer to the following GitHub issues:
- [open-vm-tools](https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/issues/684).
- [cloud-init](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/issues/4188).

## Oidc refresh tokens are invalidated when the same user/client id pair is authenticated multiple times

### Problem

For oidc authentication to user cluster there is always the same issuer used. This leads to invalidation of refresh tokens when a new authentication happens with the same user because existing refresh tokens for the same user/client pair are invalidated when a new one is requested.


### Root Cause

By default it is only possible to have one refresh token per user/client pair in dex for security reasons. There is an open issue regarding this in the [upstream repository](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/issues/981). The refresh token has by default also no expiration set. This is useful to stay logged in over a longer time because the id_token can be refreshed unless the refresh token is invalidated.

One example would be to download a kubeconfig of one cluster and then of another with the same user. You should only be able to use the first kubeconfig until the id_token expires because the refresh token was already invalidated by the download of the second one.

### Solution

You can either change this in dex configuration by setting `userIDKey` to `jti` in the connector section or you could configure an other oidc provider which supports multiple refresh tokens per user-client pair like keycloak does by default.

#### dex

The following yaml snippet is an example how to configure an oidc connector to keep the refresh tokens.

```yaml
    connectors:
      - id: oidc
        name: OIDC
        type: Google
        config:
          clientID: <client_id>
          clientSecret: <client_secret>
          redirectURI: https://kkp.example.com/dex/callback
          scopes:
            - openid
            - profile
            - email
            - offline_access
          # Workaround to support multiple user_id/client_id pairs concurrently
          userIDKey: jti
```

#### external provider

For an explanation how to configure an other oidc provider than dex take a look at [oidc-provider-configuration]({{< ref "../../tutorials-howtos/oidc-provider-configuration" >}}).

### security implications regarding dex solution

For dex this has some implications. With this configuration a token is generated for each user session. The number of objects stored in kubernetes regarding refresh tokens has no limit anymore. The principle that one refresh belongs to one user/client pair is a security consideration which would be ignored in that case. The only way to revoke a refresh token is then to do it via grpc api which is not exposed by default or by manually deleting the related refreshtoken resource in the kubernetes cluster.
