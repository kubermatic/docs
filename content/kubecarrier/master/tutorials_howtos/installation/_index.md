# Installation
KubeCarrier is distributed via a public container registry [quay.io/kubecarrier](https://quay.io/kubecarrier).
While the installation of KubeCarrier components in the Management Cluster is managed by the KubeCarrier operator,
the operator itself can be installed either via our [kubectl plugin]({{< relref "./kubectl" >}}),
or as a [Kubermatic Kubernetes Platform (KKP) Addon]({{< relref "./kkp_addon" >}}).
