To aid in setting up the seed and master clusters, we provide [KubeOne](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/) which can be used to set up a highly-available Kubernetes cluster.

Refer to the [KubeOne readme](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/) and [documentation](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/tree/master/docs) for details on
how to use it.

Please take note of the [recommended hardware and networking requirements](/requirements/cluster_requirements/) before provisioning a cluster.
