#### Step 1 – Specify the cluster name and Kubernetes version

The cluster name is how you will identify your Kubernetes cluster instance. Choose a name that is easy for you to remember. You must also select your desired Kubernetes version.

#### Step 3 – Select the datacenter of your cloud provider

This is the datacenter of your cloud provider. Your worker nodes will get deployed there.

#### Step 4 – Enter your provider credentials and configure your worker nodes

Enter your provider specific credentials so that Kubermatic can configure your worker machines and integrate them into your cluster.

This step varies depending on the selected provider! You will be asked for different provider credentials when choosing AWS or Google for example
