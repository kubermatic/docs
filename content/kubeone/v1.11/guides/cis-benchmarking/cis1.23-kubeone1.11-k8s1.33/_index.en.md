title = "Benchmark on Kubernetes 1.33 with KubeOne 1.11.0"
date = 2025-09-19T16:02:37+02:00
+++

This guide helps you evaluate the security of a Kubernetes cluster created using KubeOne against each control in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.

This guide corresponds to the following versions of KubeOne, CIS Benchmarks, and Kubernetes:

| KubeOne Version  | Kubernetes Version | CIS Benchmark Version |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 1.11.0               | 1.33.4                 | CIS-1.23                    |

## Testing Methodology

### Running the Benchmark

[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) was used to run the benchmark. Trivy runs [kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench) under the hood and checks if the cluster meets the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.

```bash
trivy k8s --compliance=k8s-cis-1.23 --report summary --timeout=1h --tolerations node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane="":NoSchedule
```

### Results

Summary Report for compliance: CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks v1.23

Each control in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark was evaluated. These are the possible results for each control:

游릭 **Pass:** The cluster passes the audit/control outlined in the benchmark.

游댯 **Pass (Additional Configuration Required):** The cluster passes the audit/control outlined in the benchmark with some extra configuration. The documentation is provided.

游댮 **Fail:** The audit/control will be fixed in a future KubeOne release.
