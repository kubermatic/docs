1 This diagram shows [officially supported providers][supported-providers].
KubeOne is not limited to those providers and is supposed to work on any 
infrastructure out of the box, for example, on bare-metal.
For officially supported providers, you can use our [Terraform
integration][terraform-integration] and [example configurations][terraform-configs]
to create the infrastructure.

2 [Kubermatic Machine Controller][machine-controller] is available
only for [officially supported providers][supported-providers]. For non-officially
supported providers, you can provision machines manually and use KubeOne's
[Static Workers feature][static-workers].
