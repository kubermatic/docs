Helm integration is a way to automatically deploy a bunch of helm releases
together with `kubeone apply`. No helm binary is required. Can be used as
alternative way (to [KubeOne Addons][kubeone-addons]) to deploy for example a
CNI plugins with your own customizations, or different Kubernetes workloads that
mostly are accessible as Helm Charts.

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeone.k8c.io/v1beta2
kind: KubeOneCluster

#... irrelevant parts of the manifest are omitted

helmReleases:
    # releaseName can be omitted, in that case it will defaulted to .chart
  - releaseName: ksm

    # chart is a required field, simply a chart name to deploy
    chart: kube-state-metrics

    # where to find the chart, chan be a remote server or local directory.
    # --repo flag of the `helm upgrade` command.
    repoURL: https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

    # namespace to deploy helm release to. --namespace flag of the
    # `helm upgrade` command.
    namespace: kube-state-metrics

    # use specific version instead of latest available, which is highly
    # recommended, but version can be omitted. --version flag of the
    # `helm upgrade` command.
    version: 4.22.3

    # provide optional overrides for chart values, --values flag of the
    # `helm upgrade` command
    values:
      - valuesFile: ksm-values.yaml   # it can be a file
      - inline:                       # or directly specified inline YAML
          replicas: 3
```
