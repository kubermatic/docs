+++

This guide helps you evaluate the security of a Kubernetes cluster created using KubeOne against each control in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.

This guide corresponds to the following versions of KubeOne, CIS Benchmarks, and Kubernetes:

| KubeOne Version  | Kubernetes Version | CIS Benchmark Version |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 1.7.3            | 1.27.10            | CIS-1.8               |

## Testing Methodology

Each control in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark was evaluated. These are the possible results for each control:

游릭 **Pass:** The cluster passes the audit/control outlined in the benchmark.

游댯 **Pass (Additional Configuration Required):** The cluster passes the audit/control outlined in the benchmark with some extra configuration. The documentation is provided.

游댮 **Fail:** The audit/control will be fixed in a future KubeOne release.
