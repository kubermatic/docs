## Supported Operating Systems

The following operating systems are supported:

* Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)
* Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)
* CentOS 7[^1]
* Rocky Linux 8
* RHEL 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
* Flatcar
* Amazon Linux 2

[^1]: [CentOS 7 is reaching end-of-life (EOL) on June 30, 2024.][centos]
We consider CentOS 7 support in KubeOne deprecated and strongly
recommend migrating to an alternative distribution (e.g. Rocky Linux)
**as soon as possible**. Some KubeOne features might not be working
properly with CentOS 7 any longer.
