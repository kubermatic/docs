## Kubernetes Compatibility Changes

KubeOne 1.11 introduces support for Kubernetes 1.33. Support for Kubernetes 1.30
has been removed as this release already reached End-of-Life (EOL).

If you have a Kubernetes cluster running 1.29 or earlier, you need to update to
Kubernetes 1.30 or newer using KubeOne 1.9. For more information, check out
the [Kubernetes compatibility document][k8s-compat].

## Linux Kernel Version Requirements

The minimum kernel version for Kubernetes 1.32 clusters is 4.19. It's recommended to use a kernel version 5.8 or
newer.

Trying to provision a cluster with Kubernetes 1.32 or upgrade an existing cluster to Kubernetes 1.32, where nodes are
not satisfying this requirement, will result in a pre-flight check failure.

Some operating system versions, such as RHEL 8, do not meet this requirement and therefore do not support
Kubernetes 1.32 or newer.
