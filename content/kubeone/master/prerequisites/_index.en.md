You should take these steps before using KubeOne to ensure the smoothest
experience.

Make sure that you have:

* Installed KubeOne as described in the [Getting KubeOne][getting-kubeone]
  document
* Installed Terraform v0.12+ if you want to provision the infrastructure using
  our [example Terraform scripts][kubeone-terraform-scripts] and/or use the
  [KubeOne Terraform Integration][kubeone-terraform-integration]
  * You can find the installation instructions in the
    [official Terraform docs][install-terraform]
  * Check out the [Compatibility][compatibility] document
    for more details about supported Terraform versions    
* The appropriate provider credentials to be used by KubeOne and Terraform as
  described in the [Configuring Credentials][config-credentials] document
* An SSH key and the `ssh-agent` configured as described in the
  [Configuring SSH][config-ssh] document
