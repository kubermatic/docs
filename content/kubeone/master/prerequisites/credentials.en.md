KubeOne deploys the provider credentials to the cluster to be used by
components such as
[Kubernetes cloud-controller-manager][cloud-controller-manager] and 
[Kubermatic machine-controller][machine-controller]. Those components
communicate with the provider's API to the create worker nodes, pull the node
metadata, provide advanced capabilities such as LoadBalancer Services and more.
Besides that, Terraform uses the credentials to provision and manage the
infrastructure.

KubeOne can grab credentials from the user's environment or the user can
provide the needed credentials in a dedicated credentials file.

{{% notice warning %}}
As credentials are deployed to the cluster, it's recommended to use
dedicated, non-administrator credentials whenever it's possible.

You can skip this document if you're deploying to bare-metal or provider that's
not natively supported.

{{% notice note %}}
The credentials file is KubeOne-specific and it will **not** work with
Terraform. If you are using Terraform, consider the
[environment variables approach]({{< ref "#environment-variables" >}}) or check
the Terraform documentation for other authentication options.

## Environment Variables

By default, KubeOne grabs credentials from the user's environment unless the
credentials file is provided. In the following table, you can find environment
variables used by KubeOne:

### AWS

## Credentials File

The credentials file is a key-value YAML file, where the key is the environment
variable name from the [environment variables section][environemnt-variables].

The credentials file has the priority over the environment variables, so you
can use the credentials file if you want to use different credentials or if
you don't want to export credentials.

Besides credentials, the credentials file can take the cloud-config file, which
is provided using the `cloudConfig` key. This can be useful in cases when the
cloud-config contains secrets and you want to keep secrets in a different file.

The credentials file can look like the following one:

```yaml
VSPHERE_ADDRESS: "<<VSPHERE_ADDRESS>>"
VSPHERE_USERNAME: "<<VSPHERE_USERNAME>>"
VSPHERE_PASSWORD: "<<VSPHERE_PASSWORD>>"
cloudConfig: |
    <<VSPHERE_CLOUD_CONFIG>>
```

The credentials file is provided to KubeOne using the `--credentials` or `-c`
flag, such as:

```bash
kubeone install --manifest kubeone.yaml --credentials credentials.yaml -t tf.json
```

## Environment Variables in the Configuration Manifest

KubeOne can source values for supported fields in the configuration manifest
directly from the environment. The value has to be in the format of
`env:<<ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE>>`.

In the following table you can find the configuration manifest fields with
support for sourcing value using the `env:` prefix:

| Variable                 | Type   | Default Value | Description               |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `hosts.ssh_agent_socket` | string | ""            | Socket to be used for SSH |
