## Supported Providers

KubeOne works on any infrastructure out of the box. Natively supported
providers have support for additional features and are frequently tested with
the current KubeOne version. The additional features include the KubeOne
Terraform integration and the integration with Kubermatic machine-controller.

KubeOne supports AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, GCP, Hetzner Cloud, Nutanix\*,
OpenStack, Packet, and VMware vSphere.

\* Nutanix is supported as of KubeOne 1.4.0.
