## Overview

KubeLB Dashboard is the web UI for KubeLB. A single chart and binary cover both
Community Edition and Enterprise Edition; there is no separate EE build. Source code
and upstream documentation are at
[kubermatic/kubelb-dashboard](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubelb-dashboard).

The dashboard browses tenants, LoadBalancers, Routes, and Gateway API
resources, and renders a [live traffic graph](#traffic-view-hubble),
[per-proxy metrics](#metrics-prometheus), and [Kubernetes events](#events) on
detail pages. Enterprise Edition adds
[WAF policy management](#waf-policies-enterprise-edition) and a read-only
[AI &amp; MCP gateway](#ai--mcp-gateways-enterprise-edition) view.

## Prerequisites

- A running KubeLB management cluster with the KubeLB Manager installed; see
  the [installation guide]({{< relref "../installation" >}}). The dashboard is
  deployed alongside the manager in the `kubelb` namespace.
- A Gateway (Gateway API) or Ingress controller on the management cluster to
  expose the dashboard.
- Optional: a Hubble Relay for the [Traffic view](#traffic-view-hubble) and a
  Prometheus that scrapes the KubeLB Envoy proxies for the
  [Metrics tab](#metrics-prometheus).

## Install

Install the dashboard from the Kubermatic OCI registry:

```bash
helm upgrade kubelb-dashboard \
  oci://quay.io/kubermatic/helm-charts/kubelb-dashboard \
  --version v1.0.1 \
  --namespace kubelb --create-namespace --install
```

The dashboard is deployed alongside the KubeLB Manager in the `kubelb`
namespace on the management cluster.

## Expose via HTTPRoute

Enable the chart's built-in HTTPRoute (Gateway API v1) with `--set` flags. It
is independent of `ingress.enabled`; both may be enabled simultaneously.

```bash
helm install kubelb-dashboard oci://quay.io/kubermatic/helm-charts/kubelb-dashboard \
  --set httpRoute.enabled=true \
  --set httpRoute.parentRefs[0].name=kubelb \
  --set httpRoute.parentRefs[0].namespace=kubelb \
  --set httpRoute.hostnames[0]=app.example.com
```

Equivalent `values.yaml`:

```yaml
httpRoute:
  enabled: true
  parentRefs:
    - name: kubelb
      namespace: kubelb
  hostnames:
    - app.example.com
```

`parentRefs` must point at an existing Gateway. Omitting `httpRoute.rules`
routes PathPrefix `/` to the dashboard Service on `service.port`; override
`rules` for custom matches or backends.

## Expose via Ingress

Enable the chart's built-in Ingress with `--set` flags:

```bash
helm install kubelb-dashboard oci://quay.io/kubermatic/helm-charts/kubelb-dashboard \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.className=nginx \
  --set ingress.hosts[0].host=app.example.com \
  --set ingress.hosts[0].paths[0].path=/ \
  --set ingress.hosts[0].paths[0].pathType=Prefix
```

Equivalent `values.yaml`:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: nginx
  hosts:
    - host: app.example.com
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
```

For TLS termination, pair the Ingress with
[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) and populate `ingress.tls` and
`ingress.annotations` accordingly.

## Editions

The edition is detected at runtime by probing for the `wafpolicies` CRD, which
is present in Enterprise Edition and absent in Community Edition. On Community
Edition the Enterprise-only navigation entries and detail-page sections are
hidden; on Enterprise Edition they appear automatically.

| Capability                                    | Community | Enterprise |
| --------------------------------------------- | :-------: | :--------: |
| Tenants, LoadBalancers, Routes, Gateway API   |     ✓     |     ✓      |
| Traffic view, Metrics, Events, Watch          |     ✓     |     ✓      |
| WAF policy management                         |           |     ✓      |
| AI &amp; MCP gateways                         |           |     ✓ *    |
| Tenant tunnel / circuit-breaker / limit fields|           |     ✓      |

<small>* AI &amp; MCP gateways additionally require the agentgateway addon; see below.</small>

## Traffic View (Hubble)

The **Traffic** view renders a live service-to-service graph and an accompanying
flow table sourced from [Cilium Hubble](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/observability/hubble/).
Select a time window (`1m`, `5m`, `15m`, or `1h`), filter flows, and open a
per-proxy subgraph to focus on the traffic handled by a single KubeLB Envoy
proxy. A detail panel breaks down the selected edge or flow.

![Live traffic graph](/img/kubelb/common/dashboard/traffic.png?classes=shadow,border "Live service-to-service graph and flow table")

Point the dashboard at the Hubble Relay gRPC endpoint:

```yaml
traffic:
  hubbleRelayAddress: hubble-relay.kube-system.svc:80
```

The Traffic view is **capability-gated**: when no Hubble Relay is reachable, the
view is hidden entirely. When the relay is served over mTLS on port `443`, the
dashboard loads client certificates automatically during
[auto-discovery](#observability-auto-discovery); for a TLS relay on a non-standard
port, set an explicit address and supply the certificate material through the
`HUBBLE_RELAY_TLS_*` [environment variables](#environment-variable-reference).

## Metrics (Prometheus)

The **Metrics** tab on an Envoy Proxy detail page shows per-proxy metrics
(request rate, 5xx errors, p99 latency, and active connections) computed from
the Envoy series scraped by Prometheus.

![Per-proxy metrics](/img/kubelb/common/dashboard/metrics.png?classes=shadow,border "Per-proxy metrics on an Envoy Proxy detail page")

Point the dashboard at a Prometheus that scrapes the KubeLB Envoy proxies:

```yaml
metrics:
  prometheusUrl: http://prometheus.monitoring.svc:9090
```

Metrics are **capability-gated**: if Prometheus is unreachable or does not expose
the Envoy series, the metrics panels are hidden. The API templates all PromQL
server-side from a fixed set of named queries. The browser never sends raw
PromQL, so the dashboard cannot be used as an open Prometheus proxy.

## Observability Auto-Discovery

{{% notice note %}}
Auto-discovery is an upcoming feature. It is available on the dashboard `main`
branch and ships in a future release; the `traffic.autoDiscover` and
`metrics.autoDiscover` values are no-ops on older dashboard images.
{{% /notice %}}

When `traffic.hubbleRelayAddress` and `metrics.prometheusUrl` are left empty,
the API discovers the in-cluster observability backends itself:

- **Hubble Relay**: the API looks for a Service labelled `k8s-app=hubble-relay`
  in any namespace, falling back to a Service named `hubble-relay` in
  `kube-system` or `cilium`. A relay on port `443` is treated as mTLS and its
  client certificates are loaded from the `hubble-relay-client-certs` Secret.
- **Prometheus**: the API probes well-known Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics
  Service locations and selects the first one that exposes the Envoy series
  the metrics panels need.

Discovery goes through Services only, never Pods, so it needs no RBAC beyond
what the chart already grants (cluster-wide read on `services`, `secrets`, and
`namespaces`). An explicitly configured address always wins over discovery.
While a source stays unavailable, the API re-checks every 5 minutes, so a
cluster that installs Prometheus or Hubble later is picked up without a
restart.

Auto-discovery is enabled by default. To pin the dashboard to explicitly
configured endpoints, disable it:

```yaml
traffic:
  autoDiscover: false
metrics:
  autoDiscover: false
```

## Events

Resource detail pages list the Kubernetes **Events** associated with the object,
so you can see the recent reconcile activity for a tenant, LoadBalancer, or Route
without leaving the dashboard.

![Events on a detail page](/img/kubelb/common/dashboard/events.png?classes=shadow,border "Kubernetes events on a resource detail page")

## Watch Streaming

By default the dashboard polls resource lists every 15 seconds. Enable Kubernetes
**watch streaming** to receive updates as they happen:

```yaml
watch:
  enabled: true
```

Enable watch streaming per deployment once validated against your cluster. If
a watch stream fails, the dashboard falls back to polling.

## Read-Only Mode

Run the dashboard in **read-only mode** to disable all mutating operations:

```yaml
readOnly: true
```

In this mode the API rejects mutating requests to the Kubernetes API and the UI
hides every create, edit, and delete control. When `rbac.create` is `true`, the
generated ClusterRole is additionally narrowed to read-only verbs
(`get`, `list`, `watch`) as defense-in-depth.

## AI &amp; MCP Gateways (Enterprise Edition)

On clusters running the agentgateway addon, an **AI Gateway** view lists
`AgentgatewayBackend` resources read-only. It surfaces the configured LLM
providers and models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, Ollama) and any
federated MCP tool servers. Provider and auth credentials are shown by name
only; secret values are never displayed.

This view is gated on discovery of the `agentgatewaybackends.agentgateway.dev`
CRD. Because the addon is Enterprise-only, its presence already implies
Enterprise Edition; it is intentionally independent of the WAF-based edition
signal, so an Enterprise cluster can run the agentgateway addon without the WAF
addon.

## WAF Policies (Enterprise Edition)

Enterprise Edition adds a **WAF Policies** page (shown in the
[screenshots](#screenshots) above) with full create, read, update, and delete
support for `WAFPolicy` resources.

## OIDC Authentication

OIDC is off by default. The underlying API reads the following environment variables:

| Variable             | Required | Default                                      | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OIDC_ISSUER`        | Yes      | —                                            | OIDC provider issuer URL (e.g. `https://dex.example.com`) |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`     | Yes      | —                                            | OIDC client ID                                            |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes      | —                                            | OIDC client secret                                        |
| `SESSION_SECRET`     | Yes      | —                                            | 32+ char secret for encrypting session cookies            |
| `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI`  | No       | `http://localhost:{PORT}/auth/callback`      | Callback URL registered with IdP                          |
| `OIDC_SCOPES`        | No       | `openid email profile groups offline_access` | Space-separated scopes                                    |
| `SESSION_MAX_AGE`    | No       | `86400` (24h)                                | Session cookie max age in seconds                         |

{{% notice note %}}
All four required variables must be set together. A partial configuration
exits with an error. If none are set, the dashboard runs without
authentication.
{{% /notice %}}

Enable OIDC via `values.yaml`:

```yaml
auth:
  enabled: true
  oidc:
    issuerUrl: https://dex.example.com
    clientId: kubelb-dashboard
  existingSecret: kubelb-dashboard-auth
```

In production, supply `clientSecret` and `sessionSecret` through
`auth.existingSecret` rather than inline values, so secret material stays out
of the values file.

## Kubernetes API Access

The dashboard proxies requests to the Kubernetes API through the API server.
By default only an allowlist of paths is permitted: the resource groups the
dashboard renders (`kubelb.k8c.io`, `apps`, `networking.k8s.io`, the
Gateway API groups, `agentgateway.dev`, and core `namespaces`/`services`/
`secrets`/`events`), plus CRD discovery. Pod `exec`, `attach`, `portforward`,
and `proxy` subresources are always blocked, as are paths containing `..` or
`%`.

The allowlist is the recommended posture. It can be disabled with the
`KUBE_PROXY_ALLOWLIST_DISABLED=true`
[environment variable](#environment-variable-reference); do this only when you
deliberately need broader proxy access, since it removes a defense-in-depth
boundary.

### Environment Variable Reference

The API server reads the following variables. Most are set for you by the chart
from the values above; the ones marked **env-only** are not surfaced as chart
values and must be set directly on the API container when needed.

| Variable                        | Default   | Set by            | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                          | `3001`    | image             | API server listen port                                                |
| `READ_ONLY`                     | `false`   | `readOnly`        | Reject mutating requests and hide write controls                      |
| `WATCH_ENABLED`                 | `false`   | `watch.enabled`   | Stream list updates instead of polling                                |
| `PROMETHEUS_URL`                | —         | `metrics.prometheusUrl` | Prometheus base URL for per-proxy metrics                       |
| `PROMETHEUS_AUTODISCOVER`       | `true`    | `metrics.autoDiscover`  | Auto-discover Prometheus when `PROMETHEUS_URL` is unset         |
| `HUBBLE_RELAY_ADDRESS`          | —         | `traffic.hubbleRelayAddress` | Hubble Relay gRPC address for the Traffic view            |
| `HUBBLE_AUTODISCOVER`           | `true`    | `traffic.autoDiscover`  | Auto-discover Hubble Relay when `HUBBLE_RELAY_ADDRESS` is unset |
| `HUBBLE_RELAY_TLS_CA`           | —         | **env-only**      | CA certificate (PEM) for an mTLS Hubble Relay                          |
| `HUBBLE_RELAY_TLS_CERT`         | —         | **env-only**      | Client certificate (PEM) for an mTLS Hubble Relay                      |
| `HUBBLE_RELAY_TLS_KEY`          | —         | **env-only**      | Client key (PEM) for an mTLS Hubble Relay                              |
| `HUBBLE_RELAY_TLS_SERVER_NAME`  | —         | **env-only**      | Override the TLS server name when verifying the relay certificate      |
| `KUBE_PROXY_ALLOWLIST_DISABLED` | `false`   | **env-only**      | Disable the [Kubernetes API path allowlist](#kubernetes-api-access)    |
| `KUBECONFIG`                    | —         | `kubeconfig.existingSecret` | Path to a mounted kubeconfig for out-of-cluster access       |

OIDC and session variables are documented under
[OIDC Authentication](#oidc-authentication).

## Kubeconfig (optional)

For out-of-cluster access to the KubeLB management API, mount a kubeconfig
through an existing Secret:

```yaml
kubeconfig:
  existingSecret: kubelb-dashboard-kubeconfig
  key: kubeconfig
```

`kubeconfig.key` is the key inside the Secret that holds the kubeconfig file
(default `kubeconfig`). Leave `kubeconfig.existingSecret` empty to use the
in-cluster service account.
