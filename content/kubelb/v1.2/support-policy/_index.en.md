KubeLB has an open-source community edition and an enterprise edition. The community edition is free to use and is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

The enterprise edition, backed by an active subscription for [KubeLB](https://www.kubermatic.com/products/kubelb/), provides comprehensive enterprise-grade support, guaranteed SLAs, priority issue resolution, and direct access to our expert engineering team. Our enterprise customers benefit from personalized technical guidance, architectural consulting, and our commitment to their production success.

## Enterprise Edition Support

As a default, our support covers the following:

- Debugging for issues related to KubeLB
- Enhancing documentation
- Fixing bugs that block the usage of the platform

What is not covered:

- Issues related to the underlying Kubernetes cluster and infrastructure.
- Custom configurations for the underlying product suite including ingress-nginx, Envoy Gateway, External DNS, and Cert Manager. KubeLB only provides you with sane default configurations and an integration for those products.
- Issues related to misconfigured Ingress or Gateway API resources by the KubeLB users(tenant clusters). For example, misconfigured TLS certificates or missing hostnames in the Ingress or HTTPRoute resources.
