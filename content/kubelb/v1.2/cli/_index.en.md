## KubeLB CLI

KubeLB CLI is a command line tool that has been introduced to complement KubeLB and make it easier to manage load balancing configurations for multiple tenants in Kube and non-Kube based environments.

The source code is open source and available at [kubermatic/kubelb-cli](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubelb-cli).

{{% notice note %}}
KubeLB CLI is currently in beta feature stage and is not yet ready for production use. We are actively working on the feature set and taking feedback from the community and our customers to improve the CLI.

### Install using `go install`

If you have Go installed, you can also build the binary from the source code using the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/kubermatic/kubelb-cli@v0.1.0
```

### Configuration

KubeLB CLI needs the tenant scoped kubeconfig and the tenant name to be configured either via environment variables or through the CLI flags. Environment variables are preferred as you don't have to specify them for each command.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
export TENANT_NAME=my-tenant
```
