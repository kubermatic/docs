KubeLB has an open-source community edition and an enterprise edition. The community edition is free to use and is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

The enterprise edition, backed by an active subscription for [KubeLB](https://www.kubermatic.com/products/kubelb/), provides comprehensive enterprise-grade support, guaranteed SLAs, priority issue resolution, and direct access to our expert engineering team. Our enterprise customers benefit from personalized technical guidance, architectural consulting, and our commitment to their production success.

## Enterprise Edition Support

As a default, our support covers the following:

- Bug reports
